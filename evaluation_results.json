        "answer": "In its 2013 SEC filings, Tesla Motors (TSLA) highlighted the impact of foreign currency risk on its operating results. As a company that operates in multiple international markets, Tesla is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect its revenues and costs.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, Tesla reported that a significant portion of its sales was generated from international markets, particularly in Europe and Asia. As a result, any adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could lead to reduced revenues when converted back to U.S. dollars. Specifically, if the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies, Tesla's international sales would yield lower dollar amounts, negatively impacting overall revenue.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla's costs could also be affected by foreign currency fluctuations, especially if it sourced materials or components from suppliers in other countries. If the dollar weakened against the currencies of its suppliers, the cost of goods sold could increase, further impacting operating margins.\n\nIn summary, the foreign currency risk in 2013 had the potential to negatively impact Tesla's operating results by affecting both revenue from international sales and costs associated with foreign suppliers. The company would have needed to manage this risk through various strategies, such as hedging or pricing adjustments, to mitigate the impact on its financial performance.",

The COSO framework is widely recognized and utilized by companies for evaluating internal controls, and it provides a comprehensive approach to risk management and internal control systems.\n\nIn their SEC filings, companies typically disclose the framework they used for their assessment, and COSO's Internal Control - Integrated Framework is a common choice among publicly traded companies. You can verify this information by reviewing META's specific SEC filings for that year, such as their Form 10-K, which would detail their internal control assessment process.",
