This change meant that the company aligned its fiscal year-end with the end of the calendar month, which is a common practice among many companies. \n\nAs a result of this change, the fiscal year 2017 included a 53rd week, which is not typical in most fiscal years. This additional week can impact revenue and earnings figures, as it provides an extra week of sales, particularly important for a company like Apple that often sees significant sales during the holiday season. \n\nThis adjustment was reflected in the SEC filings for the fiscal year 2017, where Apple reported its financial results for the additional week and the implications of this change on its quarterly results.",

However, for the fiscal year 2017, Apple was still following the previous revenue recognition standard, ASC 605.\n\nUnder ASC 605, Apple recognized revenue from hardware sales when the following criteria were met:\n\n1. **Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement**: There must be a clear agreement between Apple and the customer, typically in the form of a sales order or contract.\n\n2. **Delivery Has Occurred**: Revenue was recognized when the product was shipped to the customer, which indicated that the risks and rewards of ownership had transferred.\n\n3. **Price is Fixed or Determinable**: The sales price must be established and not subject to significant future adjustments.\n\n4. **Collectability is Reasonably Assured**: Apple needed to have a reasonable expectation that it would collect the payment from the customer.\n\nFor hardware sales, this typically included products like iPhones, iPads, Macs, and accessories. Revenue was recognized at the point of sale, which meant that once the product was delivered and the customer had accepted it, Apple would record the revenue in its financial statements.\n\nIt's important to note that Apple also had to consider any potential returns or allowances, which could affect the final revenue recognized. The company would estimate these returns based on historical data and trends.\n\nIn summary, for fiscal year 2017, Apple recognized revenue from hardware sales upon delivery of the products, provided that the arrangement was clear, the price was fixed, and collectability was assured, in accordance with ASC 605.",
