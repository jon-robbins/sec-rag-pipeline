                    "Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 4% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in June 2020. Worldwide DAP increased 15% to 2.60 billion on average during December 2020 from 2.26 billion during December 2019. Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products.

In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 50 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in June 2020.

We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the definition of MAP above. The share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material. Our annual worldwide ARPP in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $27.51, an increase of 8% from 2019. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
                    "An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Common Stock Split On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit (\u201cRSU\u201d) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (the \u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the \u201cnew leases standard\u201d), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $7.5 billion of right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and $8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Hedging At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (\u201cASU 2017-12\u201d). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $136 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders\u2019 Equity. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, \u201cBenefit Plans.\u201d Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 36 Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing 62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.",
                    "Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 22% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 and increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. Total Other Income (Expense) Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $136 million, $69 million, and $54 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher rates from our floating rate securities and the purchase of new securities. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016, and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $58 million, $61 million, and $58 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Other, Net Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, losses on early debt conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was $14 million of income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments. Other, net, was $22 million and $25 million of expense in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, consisting primarily of $19 million and $21 million of losses recognized from early conversions of the Convertible Notes during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income Taxes The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes (GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. We recognized income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019, and income tax expense of $149 million and $239 million for fiscal years 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was (6.3)%, 4.7%, and 12.5% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21%, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, higher U.S federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation."

                    "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

                    "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, as stated in their report which is included herein. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2020, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our board of directors elected not to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance in 2014 and 2013. In addition, shares available for grant under the 2005 Stock Plan, which were reserved but not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan as of the effective date of our IPO, were added to the reserves of the 2012 Plan and shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs are also added to the reserves of the 2012 Plan.",

Unvested shares are subject to a right of repurchase by us in the event the recipient of such unvested acquisition shares is no longer employed by us prior to a vesting date. All shares in the above table were shares repurchased as a result of us exercising this right and not pursuant to a publicly announced plan or program. Recent Sale of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds Recent Sale of Unregistered Securities On October 1, 2012, we issued 94,547 additional shares of our Class A common stock as consideration to 9 individuals and 5 entities in connection with an acquisition of all the outstanding shares of a company in the third quarter of 2012. The sales of the above securities were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2012, there was not at least a reasonable possibility we had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2012. Note 11.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively \u201cApple\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Common Stock Split On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit (\u201cRSU\u201d) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.

The company's investment policy focused on preserving capital and supporting liquidity requirements, primarily investing in highly rated, investment-grade securities to minimize principal loss. To assess the impact of interest rate changes, Apple performed a sensitivity analysis, estimating that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a $399 million decline in the fair market value of its investment portfolio as of September 29, 2018. Additionally, Apple utilized interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt, effectively converting fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or vice versa. As of September 29, 2018, the company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with a carrying amount of $102.5 billion.

                    "As a result, our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $131 million of restructuring and other charges. Total Other Income (Expense) Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $69 million, $54 million, and $39 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher yields on our investments from a rising interest rate environment. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016, and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $61 million, $58 million, and $47 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016. Other, Net Other, net, consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-affiliated companies, losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Net other expense was $22 million and $25 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was insignificant in fiscal year 2016. The net other expense in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes. Income Taxes The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019. The corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, we are subject to transitional tax rules. As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 33.9%. The change in the statutory tax rate from 35% to 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate. We recognized income tax expense of $149 million, $239 million and $129 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 4.7%, 12.5%, and 17.3% for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal year 2017 related to the simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting.",
                    "In 2012, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate in 2011 primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign jurisdiction losses of subsidiaries primarily located outside of Europe for which we may not realize a tax benefit. The adverse impact of these losses was partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations. Additionally, our effective tax rate in 2012 was more volatile as compared to 2011 due to the lower level of pre-tax income generated during the year, relative to our tax expense. Our effective tax rate in 2012 was also adversely impacted by acquisitions (including integrations), audit developments, nondeductible expenses, and changes in tax law such as the expiration of the U.S. federal research and development credit at the end of 2011. In 2011, the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions offset the adverse impact of foreign jurisdiction losses and as a result, the effective tax rate was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): ___________________ (1) Excluding $81 million and $9 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, related to net operating losses that result from excess stock-based compensation and for which any benefit realized will be recorded to stockholders\u2019 equity. (2) Excluding $2 million and $2 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, related to net operating losses that result from excess stock-based compensation and for which any benefit realized will be recorded to stockholders\u2019 equity. (3) Excluding $227 million and $146 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, related to tax credits that result from excess stock-based compensation and for which any benefit realized will be recorded to stockholders\u2019 equity. (4) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions and future capital gains. As of December 31, 2013, our federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $275 million, $1.6 billion, and $880 million. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax law. If not utilized, a portion of the federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027, 2014, and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, our tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $334 million. If not utilized, a portion of the tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020. The Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets reflect tax credit carryforwards excluding amounts resulting from excess stock-based compensation. Accordingly, such credits from excess stock-based compensation are accounted for as an increase to additional paid-in capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable. Tax Contingencies We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due."

                    "For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but this framework is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations and also is subject to challenge by regulators and private parties, including a pending legal challenge by a private party. In addition, the other bases upon which Facebook relies to legitimize the transfer of such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner has challenged the legal grounds for transfers of user data to Facebook, Inc., and the Irish High Court has referred this challenge to the Court of Justice of the European Union for decision. We have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Facebook products and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India. If one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from Europe to the United States is invalidated or the transfer frameworks are amended, if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union. As a result, we implemented measures to change our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in Europe that maintain the minimum age of 16 under the GDPR. We also obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service. In addition, the GDPR requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our designated European privacy regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The Brazilian General Data Protection Law will impose requirements similar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in Brazil, effective in August 2020. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users, including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.",
                    "We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Facebook relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020. While we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers, if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we may be unable to operate material portions of our business in Europe as a result of the CJEU's invalidation of the Privacy Shield and any final decision of IDPC, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The Brazilian General Data Protection Law recently took effect and imposes data privacy-related requirements similar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in Brazil. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users.",

These laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. We have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which is pending federal court approval. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC requires us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Beginning in September 2018, we also became subject to Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. From time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 14, 2020, we had approximately 301 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through January 26, 2020. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 26, 2020, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox. Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2020, we withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $551 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans. Stock Performance Graphs The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq 100 Index for the five years ended January 26, 2020. The graph assumes that $100 was invested on January 25, 2015 in our common stock and in each of the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq 100 Index. Our common stock is a component of each of the presented indices. Total return assumes reinvestment of dividends in each of the indices indicated. Total return is based on historical results and is not intended to indicate future performance. $100 invested on 1/25/15 in stock and in indices, including reinvestment of dividends.

                    "ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 24, 2017, we had approximately 323 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sales price for our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market: Dividend Policy On November 10, 2016, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.115 per share, or $0.46 on an annual basis, to $0.14 per share, or $0.56 on an annual basis. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we paid $261 million and $213 million, respectively, in cash dividends to our common shareholders. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under the program are subject to continued capital availability and our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. In calendar year 2016, based upon our earnings and profits, 60% of our dividend payments were considered to be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible that a portion of our dividend payments in future calendar years may continue to be considered a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. On November 7, 2016, the Board authorized an additional $2.00 billion under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020. Through January 29, 2017, we have repurchased an aggregate of 245 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $4.59 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 29, 2017, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $2.73 billion through December 2020. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement."

                    "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Securities Litigation In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The claims were originally asserted by plaintiff Robert Rahimi, against Tesla and two of its executive officers, Elon Musk and Deepak Ahuja. On February 14, 2014, the Court granted the motion of Kazim Acar to serve as lead plaintiff, and gave him leave to file an amended complaint within 60 days. The current complaint seeks damages, attorney fees and other relief, and alleges, among other things, that Tesla made false and/or misleading representations and omissions including with respect to the safety of the Model S vehicle and Tesla\u2019s ability to meet public expectations with respect to its financial performance. The current complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of \u201call persons other than Defendants who purchased Tesla\u2019s securities between May 10, 2013 and November 6, 2013, inclusive.\u201d It is possible the amended complaint will modify the class or the class period. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend against it vigorously. Other Matters From time to time, we are subject to various other legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. PART II ITEM 5.",

This case was brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla\u2019s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On September 26, 2014, the trial court, upon the motion of Tesla and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and indicated that a formal written order will be forthcoming. Following the trial court\u2019s decision, Tesla and Mr. Musk brought a motion for sanctions against the plaintiffs, and that motion is currently pending. The plaintiffs have also appealed from the trial court\u2019s order, and that appeal is pending, as well. 12.

The plaintiffs appealed from the trial court\u2019s order, and on December 21, 2016, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision dismissing the complaint with prejudice. On March 28, 2014, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity and two of its officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCity\u2019s securities from March 6, 2013 to March 18, 2014. After a series of amendments to the original complaint, the District Court dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in SolarCity\u2019s favor on August 9, 2016. The plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit. On August 15, 2016, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity, two of its officers and a former officer. The complaint alleges that SolarCity made projections of future sales and installations that it failed to achieve and that these projections were fraudulent when made. The plaintiffs claim violations of federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCity\u2019s securities from May 5, 2015 to February 16, 2016. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit. Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity. On October 10, the Court entered orders consolidating these lawsuits and appointing lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. The consolidated lawsuit is captioned as In re Tesla Motors, Inc., Stockholders Litigation, C.A. No. 12711-VCS. It names as defendants the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors and alleges, among other things, that the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the SolarCity acquisition. It asserts claims derivatively on behalf of Tesla and directly on behalf of a putative class of Tesla stockholders. It seeks, among other relief, damages in an unspecified amount and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. After receiving the motion, plaintiffs indicated that they intend to file an amended complaint rather than respond to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Tesla believes that the lawsuit is without merit.",

The consolidated lawsuit is captioned as In re Tesla Motors, Inc., Stockholders Litigation, C.A. No. 12711-VCS. It names as defendants the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors and alleges, among other things, that the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the SolarCity acquisition. It asserts claims derivatively on behalf of Tesla and directly on behalf of a putative class of Tesla stockholders. It seeks, among other relief, damages in an unspecified amount and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. After receiving the motion, plaintiffs indicated that they intend to file an amended complaint rather than respond to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Tesla believes that the lawsuit is without merit. Proceedings Relating to United States Treasury In July 2012, SolarCity, along with other companies in the solar energy industry, received a subpoena from the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General to deliver certain documents in SolarCity\u2019s possession that were dated, created, revised or referred to after January 1, 2007 and that relate to SolarCity\u2019s applications for U.S. Treasury grants or communications with certain other solar energy development companies or with certain firms that appraise solar energy property for U.S Treasury grant application purposes. The Inspector General and the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice are investigating the administration and implementation of the U.S Treasury grant program relating to the fair market value of the solar energy systems that SolarCity submitted in U.S. Treasury grant applications. SolarCity has accrued a reserve for its potential liability associated with this ongoing investigation as of December 31, 2016. In February 2013, two of SolarCity\u2019s financing funds filed a lawsuit in the United States Court of Federal Claims against the United States government, seeking to recover approximately $14.0 million that the United States Treasury was obligated to pay, but failed to pay, under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In February 2016, the government filed a motion seeking leave to assert a counterclaim against the two plaintiff funds on the grounds that the government, in fact, paid them more, not less, than they were entitled to as a matter of law. We believe that the government\u2019s claims are without merit and expect the plaintiff funds to litigate the case vigorously. Trial in the case is set for the latter half of 2017. We are unable to estimate the possible loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit. Other Matters From time to time, we have received requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. ITEM 4."

                    "For certain funds, there may be significant fluctuations in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are reached. Results of Operations Effects of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business and financial results in 2020. The temporary suspension of production at our factories during the first half of 2020 caused production limitations that, together with reduced or closed government and third party partner operations in the year, negatively impacted our deliveries and deployments in 2020. While we resumed operations at all of our factories worldwide, our temporary suspension at our factories resulted in idle capacity charges as we still incurred fixed costs such as depreciation, certain payroll related expenses and property taxes. As part of our response strategy to the business disruptions and uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted cost reduction initiatives across our business globally to be commensurate to the scope of our operations while they were scaled back in the first half of 2020. This included temporary labor cost reduction measures such as employee furloughs and compensation reductions. Additionally, we suspended non-critical operating spend and opportunistically renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangements. As part of various governmental responses to the pandemic granted to companies globally, we received certain payroll related benefits which helped to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Such payroll related benefits related to our direct headcount have been primarily netted against our disclosed idle capacity charges and they marginally reduced our operating expenses. The impact of the idle capacity charges incurred during the first half of 2020 were almost entirely offset by our cost savings initiatives and payroll related benefits. Revenues Automotive & Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates, as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting. Our revenue from regulatory credits fluctuates depending on when a contract is executed with a buyer and when the credits are delivered. Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. We began offering direct leasing for Model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019 and we began offering direct leasing for Model Y vehicles in the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer, which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020. Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue. 2020 compared to 2019 Automotive sales revenue increased $6.23 billion, or 31%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase of 129,268 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries despite production limitations as a result of temporary suspension of production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020. We were able to increase deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory.",

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in millions) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. Tesla, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Overview Tesla, Inc. (\u201cTesla\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. As of and following December 31, 2020, there has continued to be widespread impact from the coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic. In 2020, we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of the year. Some of our suppliers and partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming, including Panasonic, which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory Nevada. We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations were scaled back. Finally, reduced operations or closures at motor vehicle departments, vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors resulted in challenges in or postponements for our new vehicle deliveries, used vehicle sales, and energy product deployments. By the second half of 2020, however, we resumed operations at all of our manufacturing facilities and have continued to increase our output and add additional capacity and work with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production. On the other hand, certain government regulations and shifting social behaviors have continued to limit or close non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions.",
                    "In addition, any potential tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently offset with a full valuation allowance. Note 12 - Information about Geographic Areas We operate as one reportable segment which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage products. The following tables set forth total revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in thousands). Total Revenues Long-lived Assets Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases Our corporate headquarters and powertrain production operations are based in Palo Alto, California where we have leased a facility consisting of 350,000 square feet. This lease expires in January 2020. We lease a 203,772 square feet manufacturing facility in Tilburg, Netherlands through November 2023. We also lease a number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia for our office, retail and service locations as well as Supercharger sites under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through December 2030. Included within Operating Leases commitments in the table below are payments due under operating leases that have been accounted for as build-to-suit arrangements and are included in property, plant, and equipment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $68.2 million, $46.3 million and $21.5 million. Capital Leases We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases over terms between 36 and 60 months. The equipment under the leases are collateral for the lease obligations and are included within property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the categories of computer equipment and software and office furniture and equipment. Future minimum commitments for leases as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): Environmental Liabilities In connection with our Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California, we are obligated to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions existing at the time we purchased the property from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). Tesla is responsible for the first $15 million of remediation costs and any costs in excess of $30 million or costs incurred after the ten-year anniversary of closing. NUMMI is responsible for remediation costs between $15 million and $30 million for up to 10 years from the closing date. Through December 31, 2015, we have paid $6.94 million for remediation costs incurred related to the Fremont facility, effectively settling our accrued obligation and as of December 31, 2015, we have no accrued amounts remaining. As of December 31, 2014, we accrued a total of $4.0 million related to these environmental liabilities. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.",
                    "The increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to powertrain component sales in relation to Daimler\u2019s Smart fortwo EV program as well as $2.3 million receivable from Toyota for the achievement of the first milestone under the Phase 1 contract services agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received $10.4 million of net new reservation payments for Model S while reservation payments for the Tesla Roadster decreased by $5.7 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations, including investments in Model S manufacturing, as well as restricted cash that we must maintain in relation to our DOE Loan Facility, facility lease agreements, equipment financing, and certain vendor credit policies. We currently expect our capital expenditures in the fiscal 2013 to be significantly less than those of fiscal 2012, as we have concluded the majority of our investment in the Tesla Factory and Model S tooling. This reduction will be partially offset by expenditures related to expanding our service and store network, investing in new capital equipment and tooling to reduce variable costs and new product development. Net cash used in investing activities was $206.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily related to $239.2 million in purchases of capital equipment and tooling, partially offset by a $25.0 million in maturities of short-term marketable securities and an $8.6 million net transfer of cash out of our dedicated DOE account in accordance with the provisions of the DOE Loan Facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $162.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily related to $184.2 million in purchases of capital equipment and $65.0 million in purchases of short-term marketable securities, partially offset by $50.1 million of net transfers out of our dedicated DOE account in accordance with the provisions of the DOE Loan Facility and $40.0 million from the maturity of short-term marketable securities. The increase in capital purchases was primarily due to significant development and construction activities at the Tesla Factory as well as purchases of Model S related manufacturing equipment and tooling. Net cash used in investing activities was $180.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily related to capital purchases of $105.4 million and a net increase in restricted cash of $74.9 million. The increase in capital purchases was driven primarily by $65.2 million of payments made in relation to our purchase of our Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California from NUMMI, and certain manufacturing assets located thereon to be used for our Model S manufacturing, as well as $40.2 million primarily related to other Model S capital expenditures, our transition to and build out of our powertrain manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and purchases of manufacturing equipment. Our purchase transactions with NUMMI were completed in October 2010. The increase in restricted cash was primarily related to $100.0 million of net proceeds from our IPO and concurrent Toyota private placement that we transferred to a dedicated account as required by our DOE Loan Facility, partially offset by $26.4 million that was transferred out of the dedicated account during the third and fourth quarters of 2010 in accordance with the provisions of the DOE Loan Facility. Cash Flows from Financing Activities We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from loans under the DOE Loan Facility beginning in 2010 and the net proceeds from our public offerings and private placements of common stock.",
                    "We also successfully launched our Supercharger network in California as well as our first two Superchargers on the east coast. With the higher expenses associated with the expansion of our store network and service infrastructure as well as the growth of our business in general, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $150.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. We ended the year with $221.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, and current restricted cash. In addition to cash received from our revenue generating and reservation-taking activities, we funded our operations in 2012 primarily from the proceeds of our follow-on offering, fully drawing down our Department of Energy Loan Facility (DOE Loan Facility) as well as careful working capital management. In October 2012, we completed a follow-on offering of 7,964,601 shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of $222.1 million from this transaction, net of underwriting discounts (which included 35,398 shares sold to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer and cofounder, for an aggregate amount of $1.0 million). During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $188.8 million in draw-downs under the DOE Loan Facility, which completed our draw down of the $465.0 million facility. During the fourth quarter, we made the first quarterly principal payment of $12.7 million to repay the loans to the DOE on schedule. Additionally, we had set aside $14.6 million for our second quarterly DOE payment, which is due in March 2013 and is classified in current restricted cash. In March 2013, we entered into a fourth amendment of our DOE Loan Facility. For more information, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will provide us adequate liquidity as we attempt to reach profitability in 2013, based on our current plans. Additionally, we currently expect to be near break-even on cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 2013. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Our principal focus in 2012 was on completing the development of Model S, establishing our manufacturing capabilities at the Tesla Factory, launching Model S and ramping up the production rate. While we successfully commenced deliveries of Model S to customers in the United States in June 2012, our attention during the second half of 2012 switched to the continued refinement of our manufacturing and supply chain processes to enable high volume production at the Tesla Factory while maintaining high quality standards. By year end, we had successfully increased production volume to over 400 vehicles per week for three consecutive weeks in December. This established a production level that will allow us to achieve our goal of 20,000 Model S deliveries in 2013, provided that we also ramp deliveries to the same rate. Having achieved our steady-state production level in 2012, we expect automotive sales to increase significantly in 2013 as compared with 2012. We plan to start European deliveries of the Model S this summer and Asian deliveries later in 2013. In addition, we have now started delivering Model S with the 60 kWh battery pack and delivery of cars with the 40 kWh battery pack is expected to begin this summer. We offer a variety of methods by which customers can take delivery of their Model S, including delivery at home or at the Tesla Factory."

Various laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, such as the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Credit CARD Act, impose certain anti-money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services. Under these laws and regulations, financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters, check cashers, and sellers or issuers of stored value or prepaid access products. Requirements imposed on financial institutions under these laws include customer identification and verification programs, record retention policies and procedures, and transaction reporting. To increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the United States and are applying for, or expect to apply for, certain regulatory licenses in Europe, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws relating to money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, gambling, banking and lending, financial privacy and data security, and import and export restrictions.

                    "Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Fiscal Year 2018 Summary Revenue for fiscal year 2018 grew 41% to $9.71 billion, reflecting broad growth in each of our market platforms - gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. GPU business revenue was $8.14 billion, up 40% from a year earlier, led by growth in gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization. Strong growth across our Pascal-based GeForce gaming GPUs was driven by growth associated with GPU refreshes/upgrades, new gamers, new games, eSports, and cryptocurrency mining. Revenue for datacenter, including Tesla, NVIDIA GRID and NVIDIA DGX, was $1.93 billion, up 133% year on year, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture, including V100 GPU accelerators, which began shipping in the first half of fiscal year 2018 and are available through major computer makers and cloud providers, new DGX systems, and design wins in HPC. Professional visualization revenue grew 12% year over year to $934 million, led by ultra-high-end and high-end desktop workstations, as well as unique form factors and emerging opportunities, including AI, deep learning, VR and rendering. Tegra processor business revenue was $1.53 billion, up 86% from a year ago. Tegra processor business revenue includes SOC modules for the Nintendo Switch gaming console and development services. Also included was automotive revenue of $558 million, which was up 15% from a year earlier, incorporating infotainment modules, production DRIVE PX platforms, and development agreements for self-driving cars. Revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Gross margin for fiscal year 2018 was 59.9%, compared with 58.8% a year earlier, reflecting a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPUs, and the growth of our GPU computing platform for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization, partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel. Operating expenses for fiscal year 2018 were $2.61 billion, up from $2.13 billion in the previous year. This reflects growth in employees and related costs, as well as investments in growth initiatives, including gaming, AI, and autonomous driving. We recorded a U.S. tax reform provisional net tax benefit of $133 million associated with the one-time transition tax on our historical foreign earnings and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to the lower corporate tax rate. Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2018 were $3.05 billion and $4.82, respectively, up 83% and 88%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins. We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2018 through a combination of $909 million in share repurchases and $341 million in quarterly cash dividends. In November 2017, we declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per share from $0.14 per share. For fiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.11 billion as of January 28, 2018, compared with $6.80 billion as of January 29, 2017. The increase was primarily related to the increase in operating income.",
                    "Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 133%, reflecting strong demand from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated GPU computing as well as demand for HPC, DGX AI supercomputing and GRID virtualization platforms. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 12% due primarily to higher sales in both high-end desktop and mobile workstation products. Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs increased by over 90% due primarily to strong demand for GPU products targeted for cryptocurrency mining. Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue was up slightly in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. This was driven by an increase of over 15% in automotive revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, production DRIVE PX platforms, and development agreements with automotive companies, offset by a decline of approximately 15% in SOC modules for gaming platforms and related development services. Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 86% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. This was driven by an increase of over 300% in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms and development services, and an increase of 15% in automotive revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements for self-driving cars. All Other. Our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. For fiscal year 2018, we recognized related revenue of $43 million, down from $264 million for fiscal year 2017. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 87% of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. In fiscal year 2017, we had one customer that represented 12% of our total revenue. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 61.2%, 59.9%, and 58.8% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2019 reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the impact of approximately $128 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of $57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue, and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.",
                    "Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. This was driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 9% in Automotive revenue, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services agreements. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. Inventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019. Operating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 10% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. Total Other Income, Net Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $178 million and $136 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016.",
                    "The increase in fiscal year 2019 reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the impact of approximately $128 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of $57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue, and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Inventory provisions totaled $270 million, $48 million, and $62 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $41 million, $35 million, and $51 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to strong sales of high-end GeForce gaming GPUs and revenue growth in Datacenter, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to strong sales of our GeForce gaming GPU products and revenue growth in datacenter, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to a favorable mix shift. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to revenue growth in gaming development platforms and automotive. Operating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 32% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 and increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense.

Total Other Income (Expense) Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $136 million, $69 million, and $54 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher rates from our floating rate securities and the purchase of new securities.",

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cItem 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company and Our Businesses Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of VR, HPC, and AI. Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive. Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Fiscal Year 2019 Summary Revenue for fiscal year 2019 increased 21% year over year, reflecting growth in each of our market platforms - gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. GPU business revenue was $10.17 billion, up 25% from a year earlier. Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes automotive, SOC modules for gaming platforms, and embedded edge AI platforms - was $1.54 billion, up slightly from a year ago. Gaming revenue was $6.25 billion, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in gaming GPUs. Gaming GPU growth was fueled by Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by gaming notebooks based on our Max-Q technology. We experienced significant volatility in our Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2019. We believe demand for our desktop gaming GPU products used by end users for cryptocurrency mining and its after-effects have distorted trends in Gaming revenue. We also believe that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China have impacted consumer demand for our GeForce gaming GPU products. In addition, sales of certain high-end GeForce gaming GPUs using our new Turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. As a result, during a portion of fiscal year 2019, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory. For fiscal year 2020, we expect our Gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year 2019, with expected growth from sales of Turing-based GPU products and notebook GPU products partially offsetting decreases that we believe were caused by the previously-noted factors."

Our corporate campus is comprised of approximately 36 acres of land and twelve commercial buildings and seven other leased buildings with five used primarily as office buildings, one used primarily as warehouse space and the other remaining used primarily as lab space. In addition, we also lease a data center space in Santa Clara.

                    "We expect to deliver approximately 55,000 Model S and X vehicles worldwide in 2015, approximately 74% more deliveries than we achieved in 2014. To support this growth, we plan to continue to expand our Supercharger, stores and service infrastructure worldwide as well as to provide better service in areas with a high concentration of Model S customers. As we now offer Model S in countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia, our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence. Based on our current projections, we expect our long-term sales outside of North America will increase to almost half of our worldwide automotive sales. Despite initial challenges in China, we plan to continue to invest in our infrastructure in China as we believe that the country could be one of our largest markets within a few years. However, as compared to markets in the United States and Europe, we have relatively limited experience in Asian markets; thus, we may face continuing difficulties meeting our future expansion plans in Asia. Trends in Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses Our capital expenditures and operating expenses significantly increased in 2014. As we continue to invest in the long term growth of Tesla, capital spending and operating expenses will continue to increase, but at a more moderate pace than in 2014. During 2015, capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.5 billion as we expand production capacity, complete Model X development, and invest in the Gigafactory, our stores and service centers. We also plan to grow our Supercharger network by over 50% this year as well as continue other product development programs, including Model 3. Our operating expenses will continue to grow in 2015, but at less than half the pace of growth in 2014, or approximately 45% to 50% annualized. Our R&D expenses in particular will continue to increase as we complete the development, validation, and testing of Model X and accelerate design and engineering work on Model 3. Growth of sales, general and administrative expenses will be more modest as we will be particularly focused on increasing operational efficiency while we continue to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure. Over time, we expect overall operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 the net book value of our Supercharger network was $107.8 million and $25.6 million and currently includes 380 locations globally. We plan to continue investing in our Supercharger network for the foreseeable future, including in North America, Europe and Asia and expect such spending to be approximately 5% of total capital spending over the next 12 months. We allocate Supercharger related expenses to cost of revenues automotive sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs were immaterial for all periods presented. Customer Financing Options We offer loans and leases in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. In 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and have since provided this guarantee to approximately 10,400 Model S customers. Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. Although lease accounting will continue to impact our revenues and operating results as this and similar programs initially ramp up, as time passes, the amortization of existing deferred revenues and costs will begin to partially offset this adverse impact.",
                    "This established a production level that will allow us to achieve our goal of 20,000 Model S deliveries in 2013, provided that we also ramp deliveries to the same rate. Having achieved our steady-state production level in 2012, we expect automotive sales to increase significantly in 2013 as compared with 2012. We plan to start European deliveries of the Model S this summer and Asian deliveries later in 2013. In addition, we have now started delivering Model S with the 60 kWh battery pack and delivery of cars with the 40 kWh battery pack is expected to begin this summer. We offer a variety of methods by which customers can take delivery of their Model S, including delivery at home or at the Tesla Factory. In order to ramp deliveries of Model S to meet our forecasted sales, we have made and will continue to make enhancements to the delivery process. Should these delivery process enhancements not achieve our objectives, the timing of automotive sales recognition will be delayed and will have a significant impact on the projected growth in our revenues. In addition to sales of Model S, we will continue to recognize automotive sales from our supply of powertrain components and systems to Toyota for the Toyota RAV4 EV, and to a lesser extent, sales of the Tesla Roadster. During the first quarter of 2012, we began shipping powertrain systems to Toyota under a supply and services agreement for the Toyota RAV4 EV. Pursuant to the agreement, Toyota will pay us approximately $100 million from 2012 through 2014 based on our delivery of the powertrain systems for the Toyota RAV4 EV. In January 2012, we concluded the production run of our current generation Tesla Roadster at 2,500 vehicles. As of December 31, 2012, we had sold most of our remaining Roadsters. In 2012, we began work on a full electric powertrain under the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV program. Under this program, we will continue to provide development services and deliver prototype samples in 2013. Similar to our previous development services agreements, due to timing differences that may arise between the recognition of milestone revenues and the underlying costs of development services, the gross margin from our development services activities may vary from period to period. Although we produced over 3,100 Model S vehicles in 2012, we still experienced higher per unit costs during the latter part of the year as a result of lower fixed cost absorption, manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the initial production ramp and higher logistics costs as our supply chain processes continued to mature. We also had higher component prices as many vendors supplied parts at production prices later than planned due to their own manufacturing inefficiencies. As we enter 2013, production efficiency on a per vehicle basis is improving substantially as we continue to stabilize and improve our production processes, as further cost reduction efforts are undertaken by both us and our suppliers and as we continue to sell regulatory credits. We expect first quarter material, labor and overhead costs to be substantially lower than the fourth quarter of 2012, and for this trend to continue throughout 2013. We expect our gross margin in the first quarter of 2013 to exceed that in the fourth quarter of 2012 and to continue to rise to our target of 25% in the second half of 2013, despite an anticipated decrease in Model S average selling prices resulting from the introduction of lower priced Model S battery variants and a much lower contribution from regulatory credit sales, partially offset by higher average selling prices on international sales that begin in the second half and increase into the fourth quarter of 2013.",
                    "To support our planned vehicle growth in 2016, we plan to continue expanding stores and service infrastructure worldwide, provide more timely service in areas with a high concentration of Tesla customers, and continue expanding our Supercharger and destination charger network. Since we now offer our vehicles in many countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia, our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence. We expect our long-term sales outside of North America will be almost half of our worldwide automotive revenue. As compared to markets in the United States, we have relatively limited experience in international markets, and thus we may face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans. If we experience unexpected difficulties or delays in finding and opening desirable locations for stores and service centers, we may not be able to meet our delivery plans. Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses We expect to see a net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the full-year 2016. We plan to fund about $1.5 billion in capital expenditures without accessing any outside capital other than our existing sources that support our leasing and finished goods inventory. We plan to invest in equipment to support cell production at the Gigafactory, begin installation of Model 3 vehicle production machinery, open about 80 retail locations and service centers, and energize about 300 new Supercharger locations. Our operating expenses are expected to grow by about 20% in 2016 as compared to 2015, driven primarily by the expansion of our retail and service centers as well as increases in general and administrative costs to support the growth of the business. We expect sales, general and administrative expenses to decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure. Over time, we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the net book value of our Supercharger network was $339.2 million and $107.8 million and as of December 31, 2015 included 584 locations globally. We plan to continue investing in our Supercharger network for the foreseeable future, including in North America, Europe and Asia and expect such spending to be a minimal portion of total capital spending during 2016. During 2016, this investment will grow our Supercharger network by about 50%. We allocate Supercharger related expenses to cost of automotive revenues and selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs were immaterial for all periods presented. Customer Financing Options We offer loans and leases in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and as of December 31, 2015 had approximately 18,400 vehicles under this program. We expanded this program to selected European and Asian markets during the first half of 2015. Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the next 12 months total $136.8 million in value and relate to 3,017 vehicles. Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes.",
                    "We also successfully launched our Supercharger network in California as well as our first two Superchargers on the east coast. With the higher expenses associated with the expansion of our store network and service infrastructure as well as the growth of our business in general, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $150.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. We ended the year with $221.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, and current restricted cash. In addition to cash received from our revenue generating and reservation-taking activities, we funded our operations in 2012 primarily from the proceeds of our follow-on offering, fully drawing down our Department of Energy Loan Facility (DOE Loan Facility) as well as careful working capital management. In October 2012, we completed a follow-on offering of 7,964,601 shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of $222.1 million from this transaction, net of underwriting discounts (which included 35,398 shares sold to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer and cofounder, for an aggregate amount of $1.0 million). During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $188.8 million in draw-downs under the DOE Loan Facility, which completed our draw down of the $465.0 million facility. During the fourth quarter, we made the first quarterly principal payment of $12.7 million to repay the loans to the DOE on schedule. Additionally, we had set aside $14.6 million for our second quarterly DOE payment, which is due in March 2013 and is classified in current restricted cash. In March 2013, we entered into a fourth amendment of our DOE Loan Facility. For more information, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will provide us adequate liquidity as we attempt to reach profitability in 2013, based on our current plans. Additionally, we currently expect to be near break-even on cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 2013. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Our principal focus in 2012 was on completing the development of Model S, establishing our manufacturing capabilities at the Tesla Factory, launching Model S and ramping up the production rate. While we successfully commenced deliveries of Model S to customers in the United States in June 2012, our attention during the second half of 2012 switched to the continued refinement of our manufacturing and supply chain processes to enable high volume production at the Tesla Factory while maintaining high quality standards. By year end, we had successfully increased production volume to over 400 vehicles per week for three consecutive weeks in December. This established a production level that will allow us to achieve our goal of 20,000 Model S deliveries in 2013, provided that we also ramp deliveries to the same rate. Having achieved our steady-state production level in 2012, we expect automotive sales to increase significantly in 2013 as compared with 2012. We plan to start European deliveries of the Model S this summer and Asian deliveries later in 2013. In addition, we have now started delivering Model S with the 60 kWh battery pack and delivery of cars with the 40 kWh battery pack is expected to begin this summer. We offer a variety of methods by which customers can take delivery of their Model S, including delivery at home or at the Tesla Factory.",
                    "The increase for the year ended December 31, 2013 was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we commenced European deliveries of Model S in August 2013. Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $0.1 million, a decrease from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was due primarily to the decrease in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we concluded sales of the Tesla Roadster. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception and through the year ended December 31, 2013, we had accumulated net operating losses of $1.14 billion and have used $466.7 million of cash in operations. As of December 31, 2013, we had $845.9 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including $460.3 million of money market funds. Other sources of cash include cash from our deliveries of Model S, customer deposits for Model S and Model X, sales of regulatory credits, cash from the provision of development services, and sales of powertrain components and systems. In the short term, we expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will continue to provide us with adequate liquidity based on our current plans. These capital sources will enable us to fund our ongoing operations, continue research and development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover and certain future products, establish and expand our stores, service centers and Supercharger network and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model X and to continue to ramp up production of Model S. We may seek additional capital sources to partially fund certain long-term growth initiatives, such as to build the Tesla Gigafactory and for future products such as our third generation vehicle. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we increased the number of Superchargers to nearly 90 locations in North America and in Europe. We expect to continue making investments in the Supercharger network in 2014, including in China. If market conditions are favorable, we will continually evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options. Also, should prevailing economic conditions and/or financial, business or other factors adversely affect the estimates of our future cash requirements, we could be required to fund our cash requirements through additional or alternative sources of financing. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between $650 million and $850 million during the year ending December 31, 2014. 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the Notes) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the Notes which we have recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the Notes. The interest under the Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013."

The company held cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities, which were designated as available-for-sale and presented at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. A rise in interest rates could adversely affect the fair market value of these fixed-income securities, potentially leading to principal losses if the securities were sold during periods of declining market value. However, fluctuations in interest rates did not impact the consolidated financial statements directly, as the long-term debt was carried at amortized cost.

(Case No. 19-cv-00341)**: Filed on January 18, 2019, in the Northern District of California, this lawsuit asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The allegations centered on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiff sought unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms to NVIDIA's corporate governance and internal procedures.

(Case No. 19-cv-00766)**: Filed on February 12, 2019, also in the Northern District of California, this lawsuit was substantially similar to the Han case, asserting the same claims and seeking similar relief.

Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA)**\n\n- **Nelson v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-UNA)**\n\nThese lawsuits asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The allegations were based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.

In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, we paid $186.5 million and $181.3 million, respectively, in cash dividends to our common shareholders. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. In fiscal year 2015, based upon our earnings and profits, 50% of our dividend payments were considered qualified dividends and 50% of our dividend payments were considered to be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible that a portion of our dividend payments in fiscal year 2016 may be considered a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. Most recently, in November 2013, the Board extended the previously authorized repurchase program through January 2016 and authorized an additional $1.00 billion for an aggregate of $3.70 billion under the repurchase program. Through January 25, 2015, we have repurchased an aggregate of 205.6 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $3,265.2 million. As of January 25, 2015, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $434.8 million through January 2016. In November 2014, we announced our intention to return approximately $600.0 million to shareholders in fiscal year 2016 in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and may be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions",

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments In fiscal year 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement for our new headquarters building that entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates. The objective of this interest rate swap is to mitigate variability in the benchmark interest rate on the first $200 million of existing operating lease financing payments. This interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge, will have settlements beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, and will terminate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Gains or losses on this swap are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will subsequently be recorded in earnings at the point when the related operating lease financing expense begins to affect earnings or if ineffectiveness of the swap should occur. In fiscal year 2017, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a total U.S. dollar equivalent notional value of $227 million to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts as of January 29, 2017 was not significant. We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a total U.S. dollar equivalent notional value of $99 million to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency. These foreign currency forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded as a component of other income (expense), net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income (expense), net. Under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts, we are allowed to net settle transactions with the same counterparty, subject to applicable requirements. However, we present our derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of March 11, 2016, we had approximately 342 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sales price for our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market: Dividend Policy On May 7, 2015, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.085 per share to $0.0975 per share, or $0.39 on an annual basis. On November 5, 2015, we again increased our quarterly cash dividend to $0.115 per share, or $0.46 on an annual basis. In fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we paid $213 million and $186 million, respectively, in cash dividends to our common shareholders. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under the program are subject to continued capital availability and our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. In fiscal year 2016, based upon our earnings and profits, 100% of our dividend payments were considered to be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible that a portion of our dividend payments in future fiscal years may be considered a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. In May 2015, the Board extended the previously authorized repurchase program through December 2018 and authorized an additional $1.62 billion under the repurchase program. Through January 31, 2016, we have repurchased an aggregate of 231 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $3.85 billion. As of January 31, 2016, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.47 billion through December 2018. We intend to return approximately $1.00 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2017 in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and may be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors.

                    "We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units. The fair value of our employee stock purchase plan is calculated using the Black-Scholes model. Our stock-based compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement are included in \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. The impact of gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement included in determining other income (expense), net for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $4.7 million, $(1.5) million and $1.6 million, respectively. NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due.",

Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018: As of January 27, 2019, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

                    "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.",
                    "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, as stated in their report which is included herein. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2020, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, as stated in their report which is included herein. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Level 3-Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. Accounts Receivable and Allowances Accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below: The useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense. Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations. Lease Obligations On January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02) using the modified retrospective transition approach by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 840. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us to carryforward our historical lease classification, our assessment on whether a contract was or contains a lease, and our initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to January 1, 2019. We also elected to combine our lease and non-lease components and to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.",
                    "Please refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. Our Level 1 assets consist of our money market funds. We classify securities within Level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Our available-for- sale securities are classified as having Level 2 inputs. Our Level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian. Most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on Level 2 inputs. We do not have any investment classified as Level 3 as of January 27, 2013. All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than - temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. If we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the available-for-sale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we recognize an other-than- temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments\u2019 amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings. Stock-based Compensation We measure stock-based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity awards at the grant date, and recognize the expense using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs. We calculate the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes model. Our stock-based compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. We determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables.",
                    "Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income and capital gains by taxing jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. We allocate our valuation allowance to current and long-term deferred tax assets on a pro-rata basis. We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: Level 1-Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2-Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3-Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. For our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2014, or December 31, 2013. As part of entering into commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock primarily in private companies. We record these assets in \u201cOther assets\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Equity warrant assets are classified as Level 3 assets, and the balances and related activity for our equity warrant assets were not significant for the periods ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase as cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the FIFO method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value.",
                    "Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Interest income was $28.1 million, $17.1 million and $19.9 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to higher average cash balances as we invested the proceeds from the convertible notes we issued in December 2013 in interest bearing securities. The decrease in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the result of lower average cash balances as we liquidated a portion of our investment portfolio to fund an accelerated share repurchase transaction during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. Interest expense was $46.1 million, $10.4 million and $3.3 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increases in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 compared to fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, were primarily due to coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes we issued in December 2013. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-affiliated companies, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Net other income (expense) was $13.9 million, $7.4 million and $(2.8) million in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a non-affiliated investment, partially offset by the recognition of an impairment loss of a non-affiliated investment during the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and losses from foreign currency remeasurement. The increase in other income for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to an increase in gains from foreign currency remeasurements and a gain from the sale of a non-affiliated investment. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $124.2 million, $70.3 million and $99.5 million during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 16.5%, 13.8%, and 15.0% in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal year 2015 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014. Our effective tax rate on income before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% due to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate is lower, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit and release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits. Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.",
                    "As a result, our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $131 million of restructuring and other charges. Total Other Income (Expense) Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $69 million, $54 million, and $39 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher yields on our investments from a rising interest rate environment. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016, and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $61 million, $58 million, and $47 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016. Other, Net Other, net, consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-affiliated companies, losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Net other expense was $22 million and $25 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was insignificant in fiscal year 2016. The net other expense in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes. Income Taxes The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019. The corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, we are subject to transitional tax rules. As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 33.9%. The change in the statutory tax rate from 35% to 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate. We recognized income tax expense of $149 million, $239 million and $129 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 4.7%, 12.5%, and 17.3% for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal year 2017 related to the simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting."

                    "We are continuing with the design iterations and testing on our Solar Roof product, and we are continuing installations at a slow pace with the expectation that we will ramp production with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019. We expect our energy storage products to continue to experience significant growth, and we are targeting to more than double our deployments to over 2 GWh in 2019. We see opportunities in North America as well as in Australia and Europe, where energy storage coupled with solar generation may mitigate typically higher electricity rates, as well as for projects to increase energy grid reliability. We are continuing to ramp production for these products at Gigafactory 1, including through a new production line, and we have seen further manufacturing efficiencies and improvements in our installation processes as we ramp. Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately $2.5 billion, mostly to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory 1 and the Tesla Factory, the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai, and the addition of manufacturing capacity for Model Y, which we intend to produce in volume by the end of 2020, as well as the ongoing expansion of our retail locations, service centers, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger stations. Generally, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future due to increases in expected revenues and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency. In addition, due to our cost management efforts to maximize operational efficiency, we expect operating expenses in 2019 to grow by less than 10% from 2018. In March 2018, our stockholders approved a new 10-year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones (the \u201c2018 CEO Performance Award\u201d). Consequently, we may incur significant additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense over the term of the award as each operational milestone becomes probable of vesting. Automotive Financing Options We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain markets in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Currently, both programs are available only in certain international markets. Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following December 31, 2018 totaled $149.7 million in value. We have adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. This impacts the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners, which now generally qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return. In addition, for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018, we have ceased recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach. Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery.",
                    "Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $749.0 million and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Japanese yen. Our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities, proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings. Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products, increases in Model 3 production capacity at the Tesla Factory, the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai, the continued expansion of Gigafactory 1, the addition of manufacturing capacity for Model Y with the expectation to achieve volume production by the end of 2020, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet and Supercharger network. We currently expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.5 billion. In 2019, we will continue to utilize our increasing experience and learnings from past and current product ramps to do so at a level of capital efficiency per dollar of spend that we expect to be significantly greater than historical levels. For example, based on our experience with ramping Model 3 at the Tesla Factory, we expect that the capital spend per unit of Model 3 manufacturing capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai will be less than that of our line in Fremont. Likewise, based on such experience and the substantial commonality of components we expect between Model Y and Model 3, we believe that the production ramp of Model Y will be significantly faster than that of Model 3 and cost less per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of Model 3 at Fremont. Considering the pipeline of new products planned at this point, and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture cells, as well as considering all other infrastructure growth and expansion of Gigafactory 1, Gigafactory 2 and Gigafactory Shanghai, we currently estimate that capital expenditures will be between $2.5 to $3.0 billion annually for the next two fiscal years. Moreover, we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our near-term debt obligations (including the repayment of $920.0 million for our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due on March 1, 2019), although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources. For example, we expect that much of our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in China. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business. We have an agreement to spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory 2. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the State of New York, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months. A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth, and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our product offerings, retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger network.",
                    "We have a supply agreement with Panasonic that, among other things, allows us to purchase a minimum of 1.8 billion lithium-ion battery cells at preferential prices that we intend to purchase from 2014 through 2017. We have agreed to prepare and provide the land, buildings and utilities, invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall management of the Gigafactory. Supply Chain Our vehicles use over 3,000 purchased parts which we source globally from over 350 suppliers. We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts. While we obtain components from multiple sources in some cases, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. In addition, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available, we have currently fully qualified only one cell for the battery packs we use in our production vehicles. We are working to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers. We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, cobalt, nickel and copper. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements. Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives We have entered into agreements in 2012, 2013, and 2015 with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA) that each provide multi-year sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of Model S, Model X and future electric vehicles and expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in California. We estimate the combined tax savings under these agreements will be approximately $98 million, of which $56 million has been realized as of December 31, 2015. Nevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of the Gigafactory in Nevada, we have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that will provide abatements for sales and use taxes, real and personal property taxes, and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates, and transferable tax credits. These incentives will be available for the applicable periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on June 30, 2034, subject to capital investments by Tesla and its partners for the Gigafactory of at least $3.5 billion in the aggregate on or before June 30, 2024, and certain other conditions specified in the agreements. If we do not satisfy one or more conditions under the agreements, Tesla will be required to repay to the respective taxing authorities the amounts of the tax incentives incurred, plus interest. Tesla Regulatory Credits In connection with the production, delivery, and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in global markets, we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits that can be sold to other manufacturers. Under California\u2019s Zero-Emission Vehicle Regulations and those of states that have adopted the California standards, vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in those states during each model year are zero-emission vehicles and partial zero-emission vehicles. Currently, the states of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect.",
                    "For the year ended December 31, 2016, we produced approximately 84,000 vehicles, an increase of 64% from the prior year. This increase was achieved despite the fact that we faced challenges in 2016 with Model X production, including part shortages. In January 2017, we completed the acquisition of Grohmann Engineering GmbH, a German manufacturing company with expertise in automated production. We expect this acquisition will facilitate and expand vehicle production. In the first quarter of 2016, we announced our target to increase overall vehicle production level to 500,000 vehicles in 2018. Increasing production will require additional capital. We have started the installation of Model 3 manufacturing equipment in Fremont and at Gigafactory 1, and we are on track to support volume production and deliveries in the second half of 2017. In addition to expanding our vehicle production and deliveries, we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles over the next several quarters due to economies of scale, material cost reductions and more efficient manufacturing. The decreasing trend in cost of manufacturing vehicles is expected to improve total automotive gross margin over time and mitigate some of the higher ramp up costs associated with the launch of Model 3. We have achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and increased manufacturing efficiencies including better inventory control over utilization and minimization of scrapping materials. This is also evident through increased product reliability including vehicle, battery and drive units that resulted in a reduction of our warranty expense. In addition, we expect that the acquisition of Grohmann will further increase our production automation and efficiency. In order to accommodate a much larger fleet of customer vehicles as we increase deliveries and to provide timely customer service, we are expanding our sales, service and charging infrastructure worldwide. In particular, we continue to open new Tesla retail and service locations around the world. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 265 sales and service locations, and expect our long-term vehicle sales outside of North America to be over half of our worldwide total automotive revenue. As we have less experience in international markets, we may face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans with respect to timing and expected sales. Energy Generation and Storage Demand We believe that demand for our energy products will continue to increase. We plan to reduce customer acquisition costs by cutting advertising spend and increasingly selling solar products in Tesla stores. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we revealed the solar roof product, of which we expect to begin production and installation later in 2017. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we also announced our second generation energy storage products, Powerpack 2 and Powerwall 2, which offer significant price advantage per kWh and higher energy density. Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses We plan to build 500,000 vehicles in 2018. Given this plan, we continue to invest heavily in capital expenditures. Our capital expenditure needs include expenditures for the tooling, production equipment and construction of the Model 3 production lines, equipment to support cell production at the Gigafactory 1, as well as new retail locations, service centers and Supercharger locations. We expect to invest between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production in 2017. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net book value of our Supercharger network was $207.2 million and $166.6 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2016, our Supercharger network included 790 locations globally.",
                    "Customer Financing Options We offer loans and leases in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. In 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and have since provided this guarantee to approximately 10,400 Model S customers. Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. Although lease accounting will continue to impact our revenues and operating results as this and similar programs initially ramp up, as time passes, the amortization of existing deferred revenues and costs will begin to partially offset this adverse impact. Furthermore, while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles\u2019 resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could adversely impact our gross margin. We currently offer leases in the U.S. directly from Tesla Finance, our captive financing entity, as well as through a bank partner. Leasing through Tesla Finance is now available in 37 states, the District of Columbia and in 4 provinces of Canada. We leased approximately 1,150 vehicles through Tesla Finance during 2014 and about approximately 200 vehicles through our banking partner. Leasing through both Tesla Finance and our banking partner exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near-term revenues and operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. In addition, for leases offered directly from Tesla Finance (but not for those offered through our bank partner), we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk. We expect to increase our leasing activities during 2015. We have set the residual values given to our customers under our resale value guarantee program at what we estimate will be the trade-in value of these vehicles at the end of the term of the option. Based on current market demand for our cars, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts. Should market values or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted materially. The Tesla Gigafactory We are developing the Tesla Gigafactory, a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material, cell, module and battery pack production in one location. In June 2014, we broke ground on the Gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada. Construction continued during the end of 2014 at an accelerated pace with first cells expected to be produced in 2016 for use in Model S and Model X. While our plan is to produce lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs at the Gigafactory, our plans for such production are at a very early stage. We have no experience in the production of lithium-ion cells, and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell production. We recently formalized our agreement with Panasonic to partner on the Gigafactory. Panasonic will invest in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. We will prepare and provide the land, buildings and utilities for the Gigafactory, invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall management of the Gigafactory. We anticipate bringing on additional partners for the Gigafactory to create a fully integrated industrial complex. Although planning discussions with production and supply chain partners continue to progress well, to date we have not formalized any agreements with any other partners."

This method allocated undistributed earnings to participating securities, such as convertible preferred stock and restricted stock awards, by subtracting these amounts from net income to determine net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic EPS was calculated by dividing this net income by the weighted-average number of outstanding Class A and Class B common shares, adjusted for shares subject to repurchase. For diluted EPS, the net income attributable to common stockholders was adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including equity compensation awards. Additionally, the computation of diluted EPS for Class A common stock assumed the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted EPS for Class B common stock did not assume such conversion.

                    "For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2012, International segment revenues decreased $853 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\u201cforeign funds\u201d). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2012 of $5.1 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $255 million, $515 million, and $1.0 billion. All investments are classified as \u201cavailable for sale.\u201d Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss),\u201d a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances at December 31, 2012, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $10 million, $20 million, and $40 million, recorded to \u201cOther income (expense), net.\u201d See Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Effect of Exchange Rates,\u201d for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2012, our recorded basis in equity investments was $140 million. These investments primarily relate to equity and cost method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. Item 8.",
                    "When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\u2019s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company\u2019s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in AOCI in shareholders\u2019 equity. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements were not significant and have been included in the Company\u2019s results of operations. Note 2 - Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The following tables show the Company\u2019s cash and available-for-sale securities\u2019 adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment category recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short- or long-term marketable securities as of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 (in millions): The net unrealized losses as of September 28, 2013 and the net unrealized gains as of September 29, 2012 are related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the net realized gains recognized by the Company were not significant. The maturities of the Company\u2019s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2015 (in millions, except percentages): As of December 31, 2015, we had $8.5 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions): The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2015. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2015, net sales from our International segment accounted for 33% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2015, International segment revenues decreased by $5.0 billion in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\u201cforeign funds\u201d). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2015, of $7.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $365 million, $730 million, and $1.5 billion.

In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (\u201c2019 Notes\u201d) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (\u201c2021 Notes\u201d) in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the notes from the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of $188.1 million for the 2019 Notes and $369.4 million for the 2021 Notes in stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2014 (2) As of August 31, 2012, we had fully drawn down our $465.0 million under our Department of Energy loan facility. In May 2013, we used a portion of the Notes offering proceeds to repay all outstanding loan amounts under this l facility. (3) We acquired SolarCity on November 21, 2016. The financial position of SolarCity have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisition of SolarCity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this transaction. ITEM 7.",
                    "Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13 million. We recognized settlement and legal expenses of $30 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for the settlement with the SEC relating to a take-private proposal for Tesla. These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018. Note 23 - Subsequent Events Early Conversions of Convertible Senior Notes Between January 1, 2021 and February 5, 2021, we have received additional conversion notices on our 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes for $62 million and $623 million in aggregate principal amounts, respectively, for which we intend to settle the principal amounts in cash during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Investments In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. We will account for digital assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition. We will perform an analysis each quarter to identify impairment. If the carrying value of the digital asset exceeds the fair value based on the lowest price quoted in the active exchanges during the period, we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference in the consolidated statement of operations. The cost basis of the digital assets will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increases in their quoted prices on the active exchanges. Gains (if any) will not be recorded until realized upon sale. Note 24 - Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited) The following table presents selected quarterly results of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except per share amounts): (1) Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tesla, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d).",
                    "Further, holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to December 15, 2021 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any quarter beginning after June 30, 2017, if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during the five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the 2022 Notes is less than 98% of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate for each day during such five-consecutive trading day period or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon a conversion, the 2022 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We recorded to stockholders\u2019 equity $146 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00%. In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $65.50 per share as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $131.00 per share. We received $53 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $65.50 to $131.00 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. During each of the quarters of 2020, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2022 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2022 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.",
                    "We recorded to stockholders\u2019 equity $145.6 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00%. In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of $327.50 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $204.1 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of $655.00 per share. We received $52.9 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $327.50 to $655.00 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. 2025 Notes In August 2017, we issued $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.30% Senior Notes due in August 2025 pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.77 billion. Credit Agreement In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders\u2019 \u201cprime rate\u201d or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves. On May 3, 2018, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment (the \u201cNinth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. The Ninth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to permit Tesla to include in its discretion: (i) the Fremont Factory facilities in the U.S. borrowing base and/or (ii) vehicles in and in-transit to Belgium in the Dutch borrowing base. Vehicle and Other Loans We have entered into various vehicle and other loan agreements with various financial institutions. The vehicle loans are secured by the vehicles financed and used vehicles owned by us. 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 In October 2013, SolarCity issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2018 in a public offering. Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 1.7838 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $560.64 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers).",
                    "1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the Notes) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. The interest under the Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013. In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $177.5 million in aggregate and sold warrants for $120.3 million in aggregate. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2016. As such, we classified the $617.7 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as current liabilities and classified $42.1 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of $659.8 million and the carrying value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Similarly, debt issuance costs were classified as other current assets as of December 31, 2015. Should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future quarter, the 2018 Notes will be convertible at their holders\u2019 option during the immediately following quarter. For more information on the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes see Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8 - Convertible Notes and Long-Term Debt Obligations. Common Stock Offering and Concurrent Private Placement Concurrent with the execution of the 2018 Notes and related transactions in May 2013, we also completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3,902,862 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately $355.1 million (which includes 487,857 shares or $45.0 million sold to our Chief Executive Officer (CEO)), net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. We also sold 596,272 shares of our common stock to our CEO and received total cash proceeds of $55.0 million in a private placement at the public offering price. In August 2015, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3,099,173 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately $738.3 million (which includes 82,645 shares or $20.0 million sold to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO)), net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. Contractual Obligations We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including certain debt financing arrangements and leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing and corporate offices. These also include, as part of our normal business practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts."

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $3.2 million of interest expense, related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and $16.2 million of accrued coupon interest expense. Each $1,000 of principal of these notes will initially be convertible into 2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of these notes may convert their Notes at their option on or after December 1, 2018 for the 2019 Notes and on or after December 1, 2020 for the 2021 Notes. Further, holders of these notes may convert their notes at their option prior to the respective dates above, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2014, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the applicable notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the applicable notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of our common stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, we would pay or deliver as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Upon conversion of the 2021 Notes, we would pay the holders in cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of December 31, 2014. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2015 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2015 or a future quarter, the Notes will be convertible at their holders\u2019 option during the immediately following quarter.",
                    "Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to August 1, 2018 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after August 1, 2018 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions. The price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of our fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016. Therefore, as of January 31, 2016, the conversion threshold had been met and the Notes became convertible at the holders\u2019 option beginning on February 1, 2016 and ending May 1, 2016. As such, the $1.41 billion carrying value of the Notes was classified as a current liability and the $87 million difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Notes was reclassified from shareholders\u2019 equity to convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2016, and will remain there for as long as the Notes are convertible. The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis. Consequently, the Notes may be reclassified as long-term debt and the convertible debt conversion obligation may be reclassified within shareholders' equity if the conversion threshold is not met in future quarters. If the notes are converted, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. We may pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. Based on the $29.29 closing price of our common stock on January 29, 2016, the last trading day of fiscal year 2016, the if-converted value of our Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $684 million. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction, or the Note Hedges, structured to offset the potential common stock dilution, and/or offset potential cash payments to settle our excess conversion obligation. Cash-settled convertible debt is separated into debt and equity components at issuance and is assigned a fair value. The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, represents the value assigned to the equity component and is recorded as a debt discount.",
                    "Note 11 - Long-Term Debt 1.00 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 On December 2, 2013, we issued $1.5 billion of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2018, or the Notes. The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company, which pay interest in cash semi-annually at a rate of 1.00% per annum. The Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes may be converted, under the conditions specified below, based on an initial conversion rate of approximately 49.60 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $20.16 per share of common stock), subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes. Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to August 1, 2018 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on April 27, 2014 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after August 1, 2018 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted. As of January 26, 2014, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met. The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must be performed quarterly. If the Notes become convertible at the option of the holder, the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Notes would be reflected as convertible debt in the mezzanine equity section on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options, all cash-settled convertible debt should be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and be assigned a fair value. The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, represents the value assigned to the equity component and is recorded as a debt discount. The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest method from the origination date through its stated contractual maturity date.",

We have also on occasion included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. As such, we have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 11 - Convertible Debt 1.00 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 On December 2, 2013, we issued $1.50 billion in Notes. The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company, which pay interest in cash semi-annually at a rate of 1.00% per annum. The Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless repurchased or converted prior to such date. The Notes were initially convertible at a rate of 49.5958 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $20.1630 per share of common stock). The conversion rate and conversion price are adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including our cash dividends or distributions exceeding $0.085 per share. Accordingly, as of January 31, 2016, the initial conversion rate has been adjusted to 49.7009 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of $20.1204 per share of common stock) for dividend increases made to that date. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to August 1, 2018 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.

Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles, their systems or data are capable of being \u201chacked,\u201d could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past. Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $10.17 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 13, Convertible and Long-Term Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions.

Upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes, we will be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such Tesla Convertible Notes. For example, in June 2017, September 2017 and November 2017, pursuant to separate privately negotiated agreements, we exchanged $144.8 million, $10.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 for 1.2 million shares, 0.1 million shares and 0.1 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.

Finally, holders of the Tesla Convertible Notes and the Subsidiary Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date."

                    "For fiscal year 2015, we made total cash dividend payments of $186.5 million and repurchased $813.6 million of our common stock, utilizing a significant amount of our U.S. cash balance previously taxed as of January 25, 2015. Convertible Notes On December 2, 2013, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes, or the Notes, due in 2018 and concurrently entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions and used $14.3 million to repurchase shares of our common stock from purchasers of the Notes in privately negotiated transactions. The Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. As of January 25, 2015, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met. Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Capital Return to Shareholders Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to $3.70 billion of our common stock through January 2016. As of January 25, 2015, we had repurchased $3,265.2 million of that amount, leaving up to $434.8 million available under this authorization through January 2016. During fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 44.4 million shares of our common stock for $813.6 million and paid $186.5 million in cash dividends - equivalent to $0.085 per share on a quarterly basis, or $0.34 per share on an annual basis - to our common shareholders. As a result, we returned $1.0 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments. On November 6, 2014 we announced our intention to return approximately $600.0 million to our shareholders in fiscal year 2016 through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. On February 11, 2015, we declared that we would pay our next quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 per share on March 19, 2015, to all shareholders of record on February 26, 2015. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition, share repurchase, cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current shareholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business.",

                    "During 2018, we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $57 million. The primary reason for our other 2018 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. 2019 Acquisition Activity During 2019, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $315 million. The primary reason for these acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our consolidated financial statements, was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of 2019 acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Purchase Price Allocation The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions was allocated as follows (in millions): ___________________ (1) Intangible assets acquired in 2017, 2018, and 2019 have estimated useful lives of between one and twenty-five years, two and seven years, and two and seven years, with weighted-average amortization periods of twenty-one years, six years, and five years. We determined the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach. These assets are included within \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax purposes. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2018 and 2019 by segment (in millions): ___________________ (1) Primarily includes the acquisitions of Ring and PillPack in the North America segment. (2) Primarily includes changes in foreign exchange rates. Intangible Assets Acquired intangible assets, included within \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets, consist of the following (in millions): ___________________ (1) Excludes the original cost and accumulated amortization of fully-amortized intangibles. (2) Intangible assets have estimated useful lives of between one and twenty-five years. Amortization expense for acquired intangibles was $366 million, $475 million, and $565 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Expected future amortization expense of acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2019 is as follows (in millions): Note 6 - DEBT As of December 31, 2019, we had $23.3 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (the \u201cNotes\u201d). As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, the net unamortized discount and debt issuance costs on the Notes was $101 million. We also have other long-term debt with a carrying amount, including the current portion and borrowings under our credit facility, of $715 million and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019. The face value of our total long-term debt obligations is as follows (in millions): _____________________________ (1) Issued in November 2012, effective interest rate of the 2022 Notes was 2.66%. (2) Issued in December 2014, effective interest rates of the 2021, 2024, 2034, and 2044 Notes were 3.43%, 3.90%, 4.92%, and 5.11%.",

Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Other Purchase Obligations The Company\u2019s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 31 Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 29, 2018, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act.

                    "ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of March 8, 2013, we had approximately 399 registered stockholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sales price for our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market: Dividend Policy Prior to fiscal year 2013, we had never declared or paid any dividend on shares of our common stock. On November 8, 2012, we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program. This quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share is equivalent to $0.30 per share on an annual basis. The initial cash dividend was paid on December 14, 2012 to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on November 23, 2012. A subsequent cash dividend of $0.075 per share was declared on February 13, 2013, payable on March 21, 2013 to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2013. In fiscal year 2013, we paid $46.9 million in dividends to our common stockholders. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities In fiscal year 2007, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of $2.7 billion through May 2013. In October 2012, the Board extended the program through December 2014. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase programs, and may be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement. The following table presents details of our share repurchase transactions during the three months ended January 27, 2013 (in millions, except per share amounts): (1) During November 2012, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, or an ASR, with an investment bank, under which we prepaid $100.0 million to purchase shares of our common stock.",

The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act\u2019s standards and both the Certificate of Conformity and the Executive Order are required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. Regulation-Battery Safety and Testing Our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of \u201cdangerous goods\u201d, defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), are based on the United Nations (UN) Recommendations and Model Regulations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, as well as related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or air. We have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs, demonstrating our compliance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. We also subject our battery packs to the appropriate tests specified in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2464 and J2929 standards, which incorporate tests such as immersion, humidity, and exposure to fire. We use lithium metal oxide cells in our high voltage battery packs. The cells do not contain any lead, mercury, cadmium, other hazardous materials, heavy metals, or toxic materials. Our battery packs include certain packaging materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals whose use, storage, and disposal is regulated under federal law. We currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs. If a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles, we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from the customer without any additional charge. Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation State laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state. As we open additional Tesla stores and service centers, we secure dealer licenses (or their equivalent) and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers. A few states, such as Texas and Michigan, do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or otherwise restrict a manufacturer\u2019s ability to deliver or service vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we must generally conduct the sale out of the state via the internet, phone or mail. In such states, we have opened \u201cgalleries\u201d that serve an educational purpose and are not retail locations. As we expand our retail footprint in the United States, some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Although we have thus far prevailed in every lawsuit brought by dealer associations, we expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model. In addition, we expect the dealer associations to actively lobbying state Governors and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to Tesla\u2019s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations.",

Some states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, to the extent permitted by local law, both the actual sale would generally have to occur out of state. In this scenario, it is possible that activities related to marketing, advertising, taking orders, taking reservations and reservation payments, and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state\u2019s motor vehicle industry laws.",

Regulation-Vehicle Safety and Testing Our vehicles are subject to, and comply with or are otherwise exempt from, numerous regulatory requirements established by NHTSA, including all applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Model S and Model X fully comply with all FMVSSs without the need for any exemptions. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the United States. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements, and electric vehicle requirements. We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner\u2019s manual requirements.

Accordingly, there may be laws in certain jurisdictions that may restrict our sales and service operations. Energy Storage The regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development. Nevertheless, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local level that support the adoption of energy storage. For example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the 30% tax credit under Section 48(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the IRC, as described below."

This amount is reclassified to deferred revenue when the assets are placed in service. Note 12 - Customer Deposits Customer deposits primarily consist of cash payments from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle and additional payments up to the point of delivery including the fair value of customer trade-in vehicles that are applicable toward a new vehicle purchase. Customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery. Customer deposits are fully refundable up to the point the vehicle is placed into the production cycle. Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer\u2019s purchase balance at time of delivery. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we held $663.9 million and $283.4 million in customer deposits. The increase is primarily due to Model 3 deposits. Note 13 - Convertible and Long-term Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our debt as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands): * Out of the $350.0 million authorized to be issued, $17.9 million remained available to be issued. See below and Note 21, Related Party Transactions, for Solar Bonds issued to related parties. Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only specified assets or our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts and deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. Our debt is described further below. Recourse Debt Facilities: Tesla Debt Facilities: 0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 and 2021 and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due in 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due in 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from 2021 Notes. We incurred $14.2 million and $21.4 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes, and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of these notes. In April 2015, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which we retrospectively adopted as of March 31, 2016 and reclassified debt issuance costs in connection with the notes to related debt liability. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014.",
                    "The estimated fair value of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes based on a market approach was approximately $852.2 million (par value $920.0 million) and $1.25 billion (par value of $1.38 billion) as of December 31, 2014, respectively, and represents a Level II valuation. When determining the estimated fair value of our long-term debt, we used a commonly accepted valuation methodology and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk. 5. Customer Deposits We collect deposits from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle and, in some locations, at certain additional milestones up to the point of delivery. Customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery. Customer deposits related to Model X still represent fully refundable reservations. Amounts are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer\u2019s purchase balance at time of delivery. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we held $257.6 million and $163.2 million, respectively, in customer deposits. 6. Convertible Notes and Long-term Debt Obligations 0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from 2021 Notes, respectively. We incurred $14.2 million and $21.4 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes, which we initially recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of these notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $3.2 million of interest expense, related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and $16.2 million of accrued coupon interest expense. Each $1,000 of principal of these notes will initially be convertible into 2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of these notes may convert their Notes at their option on or after December 1, 2018 for the 2019 Notes and on or after December 1, 2020 for the 2021 Notes.",
                    "The decrease in cash provided from financing in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to $2.1 billion net proceeds received in 2014 from issuance of our 2019 and 2021 Notes. The increase in cash provided from financing in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to $2.1 billion net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 Notes, including the associated hedge and warrant transactions, representing a $1.5 billion increase in debt financing as compared to 2013. Cash flows from financing in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 included proceeds of $415.0 million from the issuance of common stock in public and private offerings and $452.3 million used to repay our DOE loans. 0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In 2014, we issued $920.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.38 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from the 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from the 2021 Notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum for the 2019 and 2021 Notes, and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014. In connection with the offering of these notes in 2014, we purchased convertible note hedges for $603.4 million in aggregate and sold warrants for $389.2 million in aggregate. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of December 31, 2015. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2016 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future quarter, the 2019 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes will be convertible at their holders\u2019 option during the immediately following quarter. 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the Notes) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. The interest under the Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013. In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $177.5 million in aggregate and sold warrants for $120.3 million in aggregate.",
                    "The holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during a quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the preceding quarter As of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 our 2018 Notes have met the conversion criteria; consequently the carrying value of our 2018 Notes of $196.2 million, $612.5 million and $594.3 million have been presented as current liabilities, respectively. In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (\u201c2019 Notes\u201d) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (\u201c2021 Notes\u201d) in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the notes from the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of $188.1 million for the 2019 Notes and $369.4 million for the 2021 Notes in stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2014 (2) As of August 31, 2012, we had fully drawn down our $465.0 million under our Department of Energy loan facility. In May 2013, we used a portion of the Notes offering proceeds to repay all outstanding loan amounts under this l facility. (3) We acquired SolarCity on November 21, 2016. The financial position of SolarCity have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisition of SolarCity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this transaction. ITEM 7.",
                    "However, there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles, their systems or data are capable of being \u201chacked,\u201d could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past. Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $10.17 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 13, Convertible and Long-Term Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt. Pursuant to their terms, holders of our 1.50% Convertible Senior notes due 2018, 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019, 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 and 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (collectively, the \u201cTesla Convertible Notes\u201d) may convert their respective Tesla Convertible Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective Tesla Convertible Notes under certain circumstances. Upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes, we will be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such Tesla Convertible Notes. For example, in June 2017, September 2017 and November 2017, pursuant to separate privately negotiated agreements, we exchanged $144.8 million, $10.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 for 1.2 million shares, 0.1 million shares and 0.1 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. Moreover, our subsidiary\u2019s 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 and Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (collectively, the \u201cSubsidiary Convertible Notes\u201d) are convertible into shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from $300.00 to $759.36 per share. Finally, holders of the Tesla Convertible Notes and the Subsidiary Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date."

We have also excluded SolarCity Corporation from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. SolarCity Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent $8.78 billion (of which $352.9 million represents intangible assets subject to management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting) and $84.1 million, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California March 1, 2017 Tesla, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Overview of the Company Tesla, Inc. (\u201cTesla\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy products. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (\u201cSolarCity\u201d) on November 21, 2016, we also are engaged in the design, manufacture, installation and sale or lease of solar energy systems to residential and commercial customers, or sale of electricity generated by our solar energy systems to customers. As a result of the acquisition, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), has organized the company, manages resource allocations, and measures performance of the Company\u2019s activities among two segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and reflect the accounts and operations of Company and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest entity, or VIE, of which we are the primary beneficiary. SolarCity forms VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests.",
                    "We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Additionally, other income (expense), net, includes a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income, net, was $111.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to other expense, net, of $41.7 million during the same period in 2015, representing increases of $152.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity of $88.7 million and a loss on conversion of our 2018 Notes of $7.2 million. The remainder of the change in other income (expense), net, was primarily result of fluctuations in gains (losses) from foreign currency exchange. Other expense was $41.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to an income of $1.8 million during the same period in 2014. Fluctuations in other income (expense) from 2014 to 2015 are primarily the result of gains (losses) from foreign currency exchange of ($45.6) million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Foreign currency losses during 2015 related primarily to changes in the exchange rates of euro, Norwegian krone, Canadian dollars, and Chinese yuan. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $26.7 million, $13.0 million, and $9.4 million. The increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests The net loss allocation to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $98.1 million and was related to SolarCity\u2019s financing arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity As of December 31, 2016, we had $3.39 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents, which included $2.2 billion of money market funds. This balance included $969.0 million drawn under our asset based line of credit and $390.0 million drawn under our Warehouse Agreement which we entered into in August 2016 to support the Tesla Finance direct leasing program. In addition, the balance included $213.5 million of cash assumed as part of the SolarCity acquisition. Amounts held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $827.1 million as of December 31 2016, and consisted primarily of Euro, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollars. Sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles, proceeds from retail financing activities, and sales of energy generation and storage products. In addition, through our acquisition of SolarCity, we expect to generate additional liquidity through the sale of solar energy systems to customers and financing funds created to monetize the cash flows, tax attributes and other incentives generated by solar energy systems deployed under operating leases or power purchase agreements. We expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months based on our current plans.",

We expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months based on our current plans. We may raise funds in the future, including through potential equity or debt offerings, subject to market conditions and recognizing that we cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. The amount and timing of funds that we may raise is undetermined and will vary based on a number of factors, including our liquidity needs as well as access to current and future sources of liquidity. These current sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations and research and development projects, the initial investments in tooling and manufacturing capital for our planned Model 3; the continued construction of Gigafactory 1; and the expansion of our retail stores, service centers and Supercharger network. We are planning to produce 500,000 total vehicles in 2018, which is approximately double our prior growth plan. We continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs. We expect to invest between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production in 2017. As part of the SolarCity acquisition, we have an agreement to spend or incur approximately $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory 2. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at Gigafactory 2 and other operations within the State of New York over the 10-year term of the agreement, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016, we have the following credit facilities available: \u2022 Senior secured asset-based revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) up to the lesser of $1.20 billion, or the value of the secured assets as determined monthly pursuant to the Credit Agreement, reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding issued under the Credit Agreement, As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding amount under the Credit Agreement is $969.0 million. Loan and Security Agreement (\u201cWarehouse Agreement\u201d) up to the lesser of $600.0 million or the amount based on the securitization value of certain vehicle leases originated by Tesla. As of December 31, 2016, the securitization value of such leases was sufficient to support an outstanding amount under the Warehouse Agreement of $390.0 million. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of SolarCity, additional credit facilities are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2016. SolarCity has financing fund commitments from several fund investors that can be drawn in the future upon the achievement of specific funding criteria.",

SolarCity has financing fund commitments from several fund investors that can be drawn in the future upon the achievement of specific funding criteria. As of December 31, 2016, SolarCity had entered into 63 financing funds that had a total of $481.4 million of undrawn committed capital. For additional details regarding our and SolarCity\u2019s recourse and non-recourse indebtedness, refer to Note 13, Convertible and Long-term Debt Obligations, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Summary of Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as manufacturing, research and development and selling, general and administrative. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory, personnel related expenditures, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. Our operating cash inflows include cash from sales and leases of our vehicles, customer deposits for vehicles, including Model 3, sales of regulatory credits, sales of powertrain components and systems, and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by payments we make to our suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, employee compensation, operating leases and interest expense on our financings. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was $123.8 million and was primarily a result of net loss incurred of $773.0 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $750.6 million as our business expands, an increase in deferred revenue of $383.0 million as the number of vehicle deliveries with resale value guarantee increased, an increase in customer deposits of 388.4 million primarily as a result of Model 3 reservations and an increase in resale value guarantees of $326.9 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of $2.47 billion as we expand our program for direct lease and vehicles with resale value guarantees. Cash used in operating activities also included non-cash adjustments of $1.34 billion, which primarily consisted of depreciation expense of $947.1 million and stock-based compensation of $334.2 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a gain of $88.7 million related to the SolarCity acquisition.",
                    "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We conducted an evaluation as of December 31, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance. Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in \u201cInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\u201d issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016. We acquired SolarCity on November 21, 2016 in a purchase business combination. We excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, the internal control over financial reporting of SolarCity. Associated with SolarCity are total assets of $8.78 billion (of which $352.9 million represents intangible assets subject to our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016) and total revenues of $84.1 million included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 as stated in their report which is included herein. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2016 which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows: Convertible Debt 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of Convertible Notes. During fiscal year 2019, we paid cash to settle an aggregate of $16 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and issued 714 thousand shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value. The related loss on early conversions was not significant. As of January 27, 2019, there were no Convertible Notes outstanding. Note Hedges Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the Note Hedges. Through January 27, 2019, we had received 57 million shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $1.50 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes. As of January 27, 2019, there were no Note Hedges outstanding.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019: As of January 26, 2020, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

As of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016, there were 22 million and 14 million shares, respectively, of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 3 - Net Income Per Share The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: (1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares. (2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares. The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes, or the Convertible Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.0662 per share. The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding are also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Warrants have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the quarter exceeds the adjusted strike price of $27.0122 per share. For fiscal year 2017, our average stock price was $59.30, which exceeded both the adjusted conversion price and the adjusted strike price, causing the Convertible Notes and the Warrants to have a dilutive impact. The denominator for diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge transactions, or the Note Hedges, that we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, as its effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of the Convertible Notes, the shares delivered to us under the Note Hedges will offset the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the Convertible Notes. On December 12, 2016, we entered into an agreement with a counterparty bank to terminate 63 million of the 75 million Warrants outstanding. In consideration for the termination of these Warrants, we delivered a total of 48 million shares of common stock to the counterparty bank, the amount of which was determined each day based on the daily volume-weighted average price of the common stock during an observation period beginning December 13, 2016 and ending January 31, 2017. As of January 29, 2017, 44 million of the 48 million shares of our common stock had been issued related to the terminated Warrants. The remaining 4 million shares were issued in the beginning of fiscal year 2018. Please refer to Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants.",

The commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a 5-year period ending on October 7, 2021, on which all outstanding obligations would be due and payable.

Lease Obligations Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California and includes eight buildings that are leased properties.",
                    "As this condition was met, the Convertible Notes first became convertible at the holders' option beginning on the first day of fiscal year 2017 and continued to be convertible at the holders\u2019 option through April 30, 2017. NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) During fiscal year 2017, we paid cash to settle an aggregate of $673 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and have $827 million in principal amount outstanding as of January 29, 2017. We issued 23 million shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value, and recognized a loss of $21 million on early conversions, of the Convertible Notes. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $111.77 on the last trading day of fiscal year 2017, the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $3.78 billion. Subsequent to January 29, 2017, we have settled an additional $502 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes and issued 20 million additional shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value. Based on additional conversion requests we have received, we expect to settle an additional $103 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes and issue additional shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value during the remainder of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and to settle another additional $55 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes and issue additional shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The actual number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based upon the terms of the Convertible Notes, and we expect to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock under the terms of the Note Hedges. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes at issuance, since our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal could be fully or partially settled in cash. The liability component was assigned by estimating the fair value of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and the liability component was assigned as the equity component. The initial liability component of the Convertible Notes was valued at $1.35 billion and the initial carrying value of the equity component recorded in additional paid-in-capital was valued at $126 million. This equity component, together with the $23 million purchaser's discount to the par value of the Convertible Notes, represented the initial aggregate unamortized debt discount of $148 million. The debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method and an interest rate of 3.15%. As of January 29, 2017, the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as a current liability and the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table presents the carrying value of the liability of the Convertible Notes: (1) As of January 29, 2017, the remaining period over which the unamortized debt discount will be amortized is 1.8 years."

                    "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of Amazon.com, Inc. and our report dated January 29, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington January 29, 2013 Item 9B.",

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Amazon.com, Inc. at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

                    "The decrease in cash provided from financing in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to $2.1 billion net proceeds received in 2014 from issuance of our 2019 and 2021 Notes. The increase in cash provided from financing in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to $2.1 billion net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 Notes, including the associated hedge and warrant transactions, representing a $1.5 billion increase in debt financing as compared to 2013. Cash flows from financing in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 included proceeds of $415.0 million from the issuance of common stock in public and private offerings and $452.3 million used to repay our DOE loans. 0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In 2014, we issued $920.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.38 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from the 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from the 2021 Notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum for the 2019 and 2021 Notes, and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014. In connection with the offering of these notes in 2014, we purchased convertible note hedges for $603.4 million in aggregate and sold warrants for $389.2 million in aggregate. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of December 31, 2015. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2016 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future quarter, the 2019 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes will be convertible at their holders\u2019 option during the immediately following quarter. 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the Notes) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. The interest under the Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013. In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $177.5 million in aggregate and sold warrants for $120.3 million in aggregate.",
                    "The estimated fair value of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes based on a market approach was approximately $852.2 million (par value $920.0 million) and $1.25 billion (par value of $1.38 billion) as of December 31, 2014, respectively, and represents a Level II valuation. When determining the estimated fair value of our long-term debt, we used a commonly accepted valuation methodology and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk. 5. Customer Deposits We collect deposits from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle and, in some locations, at certain additional milestones up to the point of delivery. Customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery. Customer deposits related to Model X still represent fully refundable reservations. Amounts are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer\u2019s purchase balance at time of delivery. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we held $257.6 million and $163.2 million, respectively, in customer deposits. 6. Convertible Notes and Long-term Debt Obligations 0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from 2021 Notes, respectively. We incurred $14.2 million and $21.4 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes, which we initially recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of these notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $3.2 million of interest expense, related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and $16.2 million of accrued coupon interest expense. Each $1,000 of principal of these notes will initially be convertible into 2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of these notes may convert their Notes at their option on or after December 1, 2018 for the 2019 Notes and on or after December 1, 2020 for the 2021 Notes.",
                    "The holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during a quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the preceding quarter As of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 our 2018 Notes have met the conversion criteria; consequently the carrying value of our 2018 Notes of $196.2 million, $612.5 million and $594.3 million have been presented as current liabilities, respectively. In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (\u201c2019 Notes\u201d) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (\u201c2021 Notes\u201d) in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the notes from the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of $188.1 million for the 2019 Notes and $369.4 million for the 2021 Notes in stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2014 (2) As of August 31, 2012, we had fully drawn down our $465.0 million under our Department of Energy loan facility. In May 2013, we used a portion of the Notes offering proceeds to repay all outstanding loan amounts under this l facility. (3) We acquired SolarCity on November 21, 2016. The financial position of SolarCity have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisition of SolarCity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this transaction. ITEM 7.",
                    "The increase for the year ended December 31, 2013 was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we commenced European deliveries of Model S in August 2013. Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $0.1 million, a decrease from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was due primarily to the decrease in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we concluded sales of the Tesla Roadster. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception and through the year ended December 31, 2013, we had accumulated net operating losses of $1.14 billion and have used $466.7 million of cash in operations. As of December 31, 2013, we had $845.9 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including $460.3 million of money market funds. Other sources of cash include cash from our deliveries of Model S, customer deposits for Model S and Model X, sales of regulatory credits, cash from the provision of development services, and sales of powertrain components and systems. In the short term, we expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will continue to provide us with adequate liquidity based on our current plans. These capital sources will enable us to fund our ongoing operations, continue research and development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover and certain future products, establish and expand our stores, service centers and Supercharger network and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model X and to continue to ramp up production of Model S. We may seek additional capital sources to partially fund certain long-term growth initiatives, such as to build the Tesla Gigafactory and for future products such as our third generation vehicle. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we increased the number of Superchargers to nearly 90 locations in North America and in Europe. We expect to continue making investments in the Supercharger network in 2014, including in China. If market conditions are favorable, we will continually evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options. Also, should prevailing economic conditions and/or financial, business or other factors adversely affect the estimates of our future cash requirements, we could be required to fund our cash requirements through additional or alternative sources of financing. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between $650 million and $850 million during the year ending December 31, 2014. 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the Notes) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the Notes which we have recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the Notes. The interest under the Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013.",
                    "We recorded to stockholders\u2019 equity $145.6 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00%. In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of $327.50 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $204.1 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of $655.00 per share. We received $52.9 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $327.50 to $655.00 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. 2025 Notes In August 2017, we issued $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.30% Senior Notes due in August 2025 pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.77 billion. Credit Agreement In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders\u2019 \u201cprime rate\u201d or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves. On May 3, 2018, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment (the \u201cNinth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. The Ninth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to permit Tesla to include in its discretion: (i) the Fremont Factory facilities in the U.S. borrowing base and/or (ii) vehicles in and in-transit to Belgium in the Dutch borrowing base. Vehicle and Other Loans We have entered into various vehicle and other loan agreements with various financial institutions. The vehicle loans are secured by the vehicles financed and used vehicles owned by us. 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 In October 2013, SolarCity issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2018 in a public offering. Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 1.7838 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $560.64 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers)."

                    "Because of the complexity of the new tax laws on the low-taxed income of certain foreign subsidiaries, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of related accounting standards. Based on recent deliberations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, we expect to be allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future taxable income in the U.S. as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Our selection of an accounting policy will depend, in part, on our analysis of relevant facts to determine what the expected impact would be under each method. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 28, 2018, we had $7.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $310 million from the end of fiscal year 2017. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions. Our portfolio managers are required to follow our investment policy, which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of asset types, and certain limits on our portfolio duration. Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to higher net income and changes in working capital. Cash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to a reduction in purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by the purchase of our previously-financed Santa Clara campus building. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2017 increased from fiscal year 2016, primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to cash provided from the issuance of $2.00 billion of Notes in fiscal year 2017 as well as higher repayments of Convertible Notes, tax payments related to employee stock plans, share repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal year 2018. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2017 increased from fiscal year 2016, primarily due to the $2.00 billion of Notes issued in September 2016, partially offset by the repayments of Convertible Notes and $1.00 billion of capital return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments. Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, we had $7.11 billion and $6.80 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the United States government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, asset-backed issuers, mortgage-backed securities by government-sponsored enterprises, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A ITEM 7.",
                    "Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $50 million, $100 million, and $202 million during 2015, 2016, and 2017. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $459 million, $484 million, and $848 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017. The increase is primarily due to increases in our capital and finance lease arrangements and long-term debt. Our long-term debt was $7.7 billion and $24.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017. Our other long-term liabilities were $12.6 billion and $21.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Note 6-Other Long-Term Liabilities\u201d for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $(256) million, $90 million, and $346 million during 2015, 2016, and 2017. The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, foreign currency gains (losses), tax law developments (including changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices), and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. The 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The 2017 Tax Act also enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. We have not completed our determination of the accounting implications of the 2017 Tax Act on our tax accruals. However, we have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the 2017 Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This amount is primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax is not material.",
                    "Intellectual Property To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Government Regulation We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, data protection, and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, personal information, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, competition, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, including a data protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has been finalized and is due to come into force in or around May 2018. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and that will include significant penalties for non- compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. We are currently, and may in the future, be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. Violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Various laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, such as the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Credit CARD Act, impose certain anti-money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services.",
                    "As a result, our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $131 million of restructuring and other charges. Total Other Income (Expense) Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $69 million, $54 million, and $39 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher yields on our investments from a rising interest rate environment. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016, and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $61 million, $58 million, and $47 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016. Other, Net Other, net, consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-affiliated companies, losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Net other expense was $22 million and $25 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was insignificant in fiscal year 2016. The net other expense in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes. Income Taxes The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019. The corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, we are subject to transitional tax rules. As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 33.9%. The change in the statutory tax rate from 35% to 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate. We recognized income tax expense of $149 million, $239 million and $129 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 4.7%, 12.5%, and 17.3% for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal year 2017 related to the simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting.",
                    "Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions): On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company\u2019s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the \u201c2018 blended U.S. tax rate\u201d). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower compared to 2018 due primarily to a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019 and the impact of the Act in 2018, partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits of $14.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $6.2 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Hedging In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (\u201cASU 2017-12\u201d). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the Company\u2019s derivative portfolio and hedging strategies, the adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements."

The company acknowledged that its ability to monetize mobile usage was unproven at that time. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/02/facebook-ipo-mobile-risks?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **User Engagement and Revenue Impact**: The increasing shift of users to mobile devices, where Facebook had limited advertising capabilities, led to a decline in the number of ads delivered per user. This trend negatively affected average revenue per user and posed risks to the company's financial performance.

Changes in these platforms could degrade Facebook's product functionality or favor competitors, adversely impacting user engagement on mobile devices.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements, accordingly. As of January 27, 2013, we had a valuation allowance of $224.8 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period. Our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $459.1 million as of January 27, 2013. Consistent with prior years, the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders' equity, if and when realized. In determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to utilize the with-and-without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits. We have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes, and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operations. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position.",

Consistent with prior years, the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity, if and when realized. In determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to utilize the with-and-without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits. We have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes, and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operations. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.",

                    "Tesla gross margin improved due to better production efficiencies was driven by lower product cost and higher unit sales, while ASPs remained stable. CPB. The gross margin of our CPB increased during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010. This increase was a result of better ASPs and higher unit shipment of our Tegra products as well as slightly better revenue from higher margin products and services, including development arrangements and royalties from game console-related products, in the comparative periods. Operating Expenses Research and Development Fiscal Year 2012 vs. Fiscal Year 2011 Research and development expenses increased by $153.8 million, or 18.1%, year over year. Compensation and benefits increased by $83.7 million primarily related to growth in headcount. Stock based compensation increased by $22.5 million primarily due to a combination of a higher outlay of equity awards as a result of the increase in headcount, a higher average fair value for the awards that were granted during the year and higher expense from the employee stock purchase program. Development expenses increased by $9.0 million related to the ramp of our next-generation GPU architecture, Kepler, designed for 28nm technology and our next generation mobile computing architecture, Tegra 3. Depreciation and amortization increased by $8.8 million, driven primarily by amortization of new licenses acquired during the year. Also contributing to the increase were other acquisition-related costs of $12.4 million for compensation charges related to the retention program we have established for employees from our acquisition of Icera in June 2011 and $6.0 million of amortization expense for intangible assets associated with this acquisition. Fiscal Year 2011 vs. Fiscal Year 2010 Research and development expenses decreased by $60.1 million, or 6.6%. The majority of the decrease was caused by stock-based compensation charges recorded during fiscal year 2010 of $90.5 million related to a tender offer that closed in March 2009. Depreciation and amortization decreased by $8.9 million due to assets being fully depreciated. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits of $23.5 million primarily due to growth in headcount and an increase of $7.6 million for development expenses. Sales, General and Administrative Fiscal Year 2012 vs. Fiscal Year 2011 Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $44.1 million, or 12.2%, year over year. Compensation and benefits increased by $29.5 million primarily attributable to headcount growth. Stock-based compensation increased by $10.5 million primarily due to a combination of a higher outlay of equity awards as a result of the increase in headcount, a higher average fair value for the awards that were granted during the year and higher expense from the employee stock purchase program. Also contributing to the increase were $4.4 million for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Icera, Inc., $3.5 million for compensation charges related to the retention program we have established for employees from the Icera acquisition and $2.2 million of amortization expense for intangible assets associated with this acquisition. Offsetting these increases were decreases in outside professional fees of $4.0 million due to lower litigation-related costs in the current year and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $9.2 million due to certain software and lease hold improvements of headquarters buildings that became fully depreciated during the year. Fiscal Year 2011 vs. Fiscal Year 2010 Sales, general and administrative expenses decreased by $5.5 million, or 1.5%.",
                    "Research and development expenses in 2012 increased $1.01 billion, or 261%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $729 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 73% growth in employee headcount in engineering, design, product management, and other technical functions. This investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users, developers, and marketers. In 2014, we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees. We expect research and development expenses will rise in 2014 at a higher rate than it rose in 2013 due to the large share-based compensation expense in 2012 associated with Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO which lowered the growth rate between 2012 and 2013. Marketing and sales 2013 Compared to 2012. Marketing and sales expenses in 2013 increased $101 million, or 11%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 36% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 to support global sales, business development and customer service. Our user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2013. These increases in 2013 were partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $173 million compared to 2012 primarily due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012. 2012 Compared to 2011. Marketing and sales expenses in 2012 increased $503 million, or 128%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $269 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expenses also increased due to a 19% increase in employee headcount to support global sales, business development and customer service. An increase in our user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2012. In 2014, we plan to add sales and business development employees, and increase our investment in user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing. We expect marketing and sales expenses will rise in 2014 at a higher rate than it rose in 2013 due to the large share-based compensation expense in 2012 associated with Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO which lowered the growth rate between 2012 and 2013. General and administrative 2013 Compared to 2012. General and administrative expenses in 2013 decreased $111 million, or 12%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $208 million decrease in share-based compensation expense in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from recognition of expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012. The decrease in 2013 was partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 19% increase in employee headcount and increased amortization of acquired patents. 2012 Compared to 2011.",
                    "This change is due to factors including a faster growth rate of international users and the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods. The majority of our revenue outside of the United States came from customers located in western Europe, Canada, and Australia. Cost of revenue 2012 Compared to 2011. Cost of revenue in 2012 increased $504 million, or 59%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to expenses related to expanding our data center operations, including a $257 million increase in depreciation in 2012. Share-based compensation expense increased by $79 million in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Increases in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 65% increase in employee headcount also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue in 2012. These expenses supported our user growth, the increased usage of products by users, developers, and marketers, and the launch of new products. 2011 Compared to 2010. Cost of revenue in 2011 increased $367 million, or 74%, compared to 2010.

These expenses supported our user growth, the increased usage of our products by users, developers, and marketers, and the launch of new products. Additionally, credit card and other related revenue processing fees increased by $60 million. We anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future as we expand our data center capacity to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and offerings. The expected increase in cost of revenue may be partially mitigated to the extent we are able to realize improvements in server performance and the efficiency of our technical operations. We expect cost of revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2013 compared to 2012 due to our investment in technical infrastructure. Research and development 2012 Compared to 2011. Research and development expenses in 2012 increased $1.01 billion, or 261%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $729 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 73% growth in employee headcount in engineering, design, product management, and other technical functions. This investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users, developers, and marketers. 2011 Compared to 2010. Research and development expenses in 2011 increased $244 million, or 169%, compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase from $9 million in 2010 to $114 million in 2011 for share-based compensation expense related to Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 57% growth in employee headcount in engineering, design, product management, and other technical functions.

In 2013, we plan to continue rapidly hiring engineering, design, product management, and other technical employees.",

In addition, we recognized $117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013 primarily due to exiting certain leased data centers resulting from the migration of operations to our own data centers. In the event that circumstances change such that we decide to re-occupy and utilize any of the data centers we have exited, we would reverse the remaining lease abandonment liability associated with those facilities.

These options had an exercise price of $23.34 per share and vested upon achieving specific operational and market capitalization milestones.

                    "Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u2019s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u2019s R&D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations. The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. The Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Company\u2019s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u2019s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u2019s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u2019s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company\u2019s stock price is subject to volatility. The Company\u2019s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.

                    "Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance. During the fiscal year ended September 27, 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) concluded its review of the years 2004 through 2009. The IRS is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u2019s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u2019s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is not permitted. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its consolidated financial statements. Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 34 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 27, 2014, September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 (in millions): The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. To provide additional flexibility in managing liquidity, the Company began accessing the commercial paper markets in the third quarter of 2014. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the share repurchase program will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. As of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, $137.1 billion and $111.3 billion, respectively, of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company\u2019s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.",
                    "The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\u2019s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. Selling, General and Administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) Expense The growth in SG&A expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses, including share-based compensation costs; higher spending on marketing, advertising and professional services; and the Company\u2019s continued expansion of its Retail segment. The growth in SG&A during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the Company\u2019s continued expansion of its Retail segment and increased headcount and related expenses, partially offset by decreased spending on professional services. Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 33 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (dollars in millions): The decrease in other income and expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts and higher interest income. The year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2013 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income resulting from the Company\u2019s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued in the third quarter of 2013 and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.11%, 1.03% and 1.03% during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company had no debt outstanding during 2012 and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (dollars in millions): The Company\u2019s effective tax rates for all years differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of September 27, 2014, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $5.1 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $20.3 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.

                    "Trade restrictions may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Many of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13 The Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand."

                    "Fiscal 2013 Highlights Net sales rose 9% or $14.4 billion during 2013 compared to 2012. This resulted from growth in net sales of iPhone; iTunes, Software and Services; and iPad. Growth in 2013 reflected strong sales of iPhone 5, strong continuing sales of iPhone 4 and 4s, the introduction of iPhone 5c and 5s, strong performance of the iPad mini and fourth generation iPad, and continued growth in the Company\u2019s online sales of apps, digital content and services. Growth in these areas was partially offset by declines in net sales of Mac and iPod. All of the Company\u2019s operating segments experienced increased net sales in 2013, with net sales growth being particularly strong in the Americas, Greater China and Japan operating segments. Growth in total net sales was higher during the first half of 2013, rising $12.6 billion or 14.7% over the same period in 2012. First half growth in 2013 was driven by iPhone and iPad introductions at or near the beginning of 2013. During the first quarter of 2013, the Company introduced the fourth generation iPad and iPad mini, a new MacBook Pro with Retina display, a new iPod touch, a new iMac, and expanded the rollout of iPhone 5 which began in September 2012. In June 2013 at its Worldwide Developer Conference, the Company announced iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks, announced iTunes Radio, introduced a significant upgrade to MacBook Air, and provided a preview of all new Mac Pro desktops that were introduced during 2014. In September 2013, the Company introduced iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, released iOS 7, launched iTunes Radio, and announced that beginning in September 2013 iPhoto, iMovie and iWork Apps for iOS would be available as free downloads with all new iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices (\u201ciOS devices\u201d). In April 2013, the Company announced a significant increase to its program to return capital to shareholders by raising the total amount it expected to utilize for the program through December 2015 to $100 billion. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $60 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $0.44 per common share beginning in May 2013. During 2013, the Company utilized $23.0 billion to repurchase common shares and paid dividends of $10.5 billion or $1.64 per common share. In conjunction with its capital return program, in May 2013 the Company issued $17.0 billion of long-term debt with varying maturities through 2043.

                    "Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. AWS sales increased 49%, 70%, and 55% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Operating income was $178 million, $2.2 billion, and $4.2 billion for 2014, 2015, and 2016. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $0 million, $30 million, and $27 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The increase in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $(27) million, $(278) million, and $89 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $41 million, $264 million, and $(5) million for 2014, 2015, and 2016. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about outbound shipping results for our North America and International segments is as follows (in millions): ___________________ (1) Excludes amounts charged on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes a portion of amounts earned from Amazon Prime memberships. (3) Includes amounts earned from Fulfillment by Amazon programs related to shipping services. (4) Includes sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.",

In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, \u201cNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities,\u201d for 2015, 2016, and 2017 (in millions): All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of February 1, 2018, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d First Quarter 2018 Guidance \u2022 Net sales are expected to be between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion, or to grow between 34% and 42% compared with first quarter 2017. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately $1.2 billion or 330 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $300 million and $1.0 billion, compared with $1.0 billion in first quarter 2017. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. Item 7A.",
                    "There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. In the first quarter of 2016, we began allocating stock-based compensation and \u201cOther operating expense, net\u201d to our segment results, and we conformed prior period segment results to the current presentation. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 11-Segment Information.\u201d Net Sales Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions, certain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Sales increased 20%, 20%, and 27% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(636) million, $(5.2) billion, and $(550) million for 2014, 2015, and 2016. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see \u201cEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates\u201d below. North America sales increased 23%, 25%, and 25% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. International sales increased 12%, 6%, and 24% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(580) million, $(5.0) billion, and $(489) million in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. AWS sales increased 49%, 70%, and 55% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Operating income was $178 million, $2.2 billion, and $4.2 billion for 2014, 2015, and 2016. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services."

In January 2015, Tesla exercised its option to purchase the Lathrop property under the terms of the lease agreement. In addition to the properties included in the table above, we also lease a number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia for our retail and service locations as well as Supercharger sites.

                    "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The following table sets forth the location, approximate size and primary use of our principal leased and owned facilities: (1) As of December 31, 2014, the Lathrop property was subject to a lease agreement. In January 2015, Tesla exercised its option to purchase the Lathrop property under the terms of the lease agreement. In addition to the properties included in the table above, we also lease a large number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia for our retail and service locations as well as Supercharger sites.

                    "In addition, any potential tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently offset with a full valuation allowance. Note 12 - Information about Geographic Areas We operate as one reportable segment which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage products. The following tables set forth total revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in thousands). Total Revenues Long-lived Assets Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases Our corporate headquarters and powertrain production operations are based in Palo Alto, California where we have leased a facility consisting of 350,000 square feet. This lease expires in January 2020. We lease a 203,772 square feet manufacturing facility in Tilburg, Netherlands through November 2023. We also lease a number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia for our office, retail and service locations as well as Supercharger sites under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through December 2030. Included within Operating Leases commitments in the table below are payments due under operating leases that have been accounted for as build-to-suit arrangements and are included in property, plant, and equipment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $68.2 million, $46.3 million and $21.5 million. Capital Leases We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases over terms between 36 and 60 months. The equipment under the leases are collateral for the lease obligations and are included within property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the categories of computer equipment and software and office furniture and equipment. Future minimum commitments for leases as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): Environmental Liabilities In connection with our Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California, we are obligated to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions existing at the time we purchased the property from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). Tesla is responsible for the first $15 million of remediation costs and any costs in excess of $30 million or costs incurred after the ten-year anniversary of closing. NUMMI is responsible for remediation costs between $15 million and $30 million for up to 10 years from the closing date. Through December 31, 2015, we have paid $6.94 million for remediation costs incurred related to the Fremont facility, effectively settling our accrued obligation and as of December 31, 2015, we have no accrued amounts remaining. As of December 31, 2014, we accrued a total of $4.0 million related to these environmental liabilities. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.",
                    "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters is based in Palo Alto, California. We have a lease with Stanford University for 350,000 square feet which expires in January 2020. In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility located in Fremont, California from NUMMI, which is a joint venture between Toyota, and Motors Liquidation Company, the owner of selected assets of General Motors. In October 2010, we completed the purchase and received title to the facility and land (the Tesla Factory). The total cash paid was $42.0 million. The purchase totaled 210 acres, or approximately 55% of the land at the site, and included all of the manufacturing facilities located thereon totaling approximately 5.4 million square feet. We are required to comply with environmental regulations in connection with our Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. In October 2010, we and NUMMI amended the May 2010 purchase agreement to include the transfer to us of certain operating permits, or emission credits, for additional consideration of $6.5 million. We completed the transfer of these permits in October 2010. We commenced the production of our Model S vehicle and powertrain components and systems in June 2012 at the Tesla Factory. We also intend to build our future vehicles at the Tesla Factory. In July 2013, we completed the purchase of approximately 31 acres of land located in Fremont, California that is adjacent to the Tesla Factory for potential future expansion. We paid $18.5 million related to this purchase. Outside of our Tesla Factory, we do not currently own any of our facilities. The following table sets forth the location, approximate size and primary use of our principal leased facilities: (1) We also lease a number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia for our retail and service locations as well as Supercharger sites. We currently intend to add new facilities or expand our existing facilities as we add employees and expand our network of stores and galleries, service locations and Supercharger sites. We believe that suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms to accommodate our foreseeable future expansion. ITEM 3.",
                    "To support our planned vehicle growth in 2016, we plan to continue expanding stores and service infrastructure worldwide, provide more timely service in areas with a high concentration of Tesla customers, and continue expanding our Supercharger and destination charger network. Since we now offer our vehicles in many countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia, our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence. We expect our long-term sales outside of North America will be almost half of our worldwide automotive revenue. As compared to markets in the United States, we have relatively limited experience in international markets, and thus we may face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans. If we experience unexpected difficulties or delays in finding and opening desirable locations for stores and service centers, we may not be able to meet our delivery plans. Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses We expect to see a net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the full-year 2016. We plan to fund about $1.5 billion in capital expenditures without accessing any outside capital other than our existing sources that support our leasing and finished goods inventory. We plan to invest in equipment to support cell production at the Gigafactory, begin installation of Model 3 vehicle production machinery, open about 80 retail locations and service centers, and energize about 300 new Supercharger locations. Our operating expenses are expected to grow by about 20% in 2016 as compared to 2015, driven primarily by the expansion of our retail and service centers as well as increases in general and administrative costs to support the growth of the business. We expect sales, general and administrative expenses to decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure. Over time, we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the net book value of our Supercharger network was $339.2 million and $107.8 million and as of December 31, 2015 included 584 locations globally. We plan to continue investing in our Supercharger network for the foreseeable future, including in North America, Europe and Asia and expect such spending to be a minimal portion of total capital spending during 2016. During 2016, this investment will grow our Supercharger network by about 50%. We allocate Supercharger related expenses to cost of automotive revenues and selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs were immaterial for all periods presented. Customer Financing Options We offer loans and leases in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and as of December 31, 2015 had approximately 18,400 vehicles under this program. We expanded this program to selected European and Asian markets during the first half of 2015. Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the next 12 months total $136.8 million in value and relate to 3,017 vehicles. Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes."

Our goal is a long-term, upward-bound career at Tesla for every employee, which we believe also drives our retention efforts. We also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe, respectful, fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business. From our outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions to sponsoring employee resource groups across numerous locations, including Asian Pacific Islanders at Tesla, Black at Tesla, Intersectionality, Latinos at Tesla, LGBTQ at Tesla, Veterans at Tesla and Women in Tesla, we engage these networks as key business resources and sources of actionable feedback. We are also working on diversity efforts in our supply chain to expand our outreach and support to small- and large-scale suppliers from underrepresented communities to emphasize this culture with our own employees. Available Information We file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically. Our website is located at www.tesla.com, and our reports, amendments thereto, proxy statements and other information are also made available, free of charge, on our investor relations website at ir.tesla.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such information with the SEC. The information posted on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 1A.",
                    "We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets. Solar Energy Systems The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems. Intellectual Property We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world. Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, our full-time count for our and our subsidiaries\u2019 employees worldwide was 70,757. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values. We want to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they become employees. Our efforts begin at the entry level with development, apprenticeship and internship programs in local high schools, community colleges and four-year colleges. In addition, we seek to hire based on talent rather than solely on educational pedigree, and have provided thousands of job openings, including in our local communities, for capable workers from various backgrounds to learn valuable skills in critical operations such as in manufacturing, vehicle service and energy product installation. We also emphasize in our evaluation and career development efforts internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development. Our goal is a long-term, upward-bound career at Tesla for every employee, which we believe also drives our retention efforts.

A significant depreciation of the U.S. dollar could have led to foreign exchange gains or losses, impacting other income (expense), net.

The consumer products included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our review is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, \u201cOther Information - Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.\u201d Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In November 2007, an Austrian copyright collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logistik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germany seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed the German case pending a final decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana\u2019s claim and in September 2010 commenced an appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of the tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditions set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s appeal. In February 2016, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. A number of additional actions have been filed making similar allegations. In December 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle f\u00fcr private \u00dcberspielungsrechte (\u201cZPU\u201d), filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Media EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Services Europe S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, and Amazon Eurasia Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l. in the District Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website to customers located in Germany."

                    "Item 9B. Other Information In September 2017, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that Mark Zuckerberg anticipated selling 35 million to 75 million shares of Facebook stock over a period of approximately 18 months from the date of the announcement in order to fund the philanthropic initiatives of Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, in education, science and advocacy. Mr. Zuckerberg has informed us that following such time period he intends to continue to sell shares of Facebook stock from time to time, primarily to continue to fund his philanthropic initiatives. Any sale of shares beneficially owned by Mr. Zuckerberg will be conducted pursuant to a trading plan established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and will be disclosed publicly in accordance with the rules established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. PART III Item 10.",
                    "This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, or if issued, our Class C capital stock, which will generally have no voting power, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock and, if issued, our Class C capital stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. Moreover, since our Class C capital stock, if issued, will generally have no voting power, the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in connection with future financings, acquisitions, or the issuance of future equity awards, could have the effect of prolonging the duration of Mr. Zuckerberg's ability to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore his ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg's continued control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock is beneficial to us and is in the best interests of our stockholders. In the event that Mr. Zuckerberg no longer controls a majority of the voting power, whether as a result of the disposition of some or all his shares of Class A or Class B common stock or otherwise, our business or the trading price of our Class A common stock and, if issued, our Class C capital stock may be adversely affected. We plan to continue to make acquisitions, which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, products, or technologies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial. For example, in 2014 we paid approximately $4.6 billion in cash and issued 178 million shares of our Class A common stock in connection with our acquisition of WhatsApp, and we paid approximately $400 million in cash and issued 23 million shares of our Class B common stock in connection with our acquisition of Oculus. We also issued a substantial number of RSUs to help retain the employees of these companies. There is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions.",
                    "Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Following our IPO, the events surrounding the offering became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business. Substantially all of our total outstanding shares are available for sale into the public market and any substantial sales of our stock could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. The price of our Class A common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, employees, and significant stockholders, or when there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale. As of December 31, 2012, there were 1,671,277,621 shares of our Class A common stock and 701,427,574 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. As of December 31, 2012, substantially all of our outstanding shares are available for sale into the market, except for 47,315,862 shares held by Mail.ru Group Limited and DST Global Limited and their respective affiliates, which will be eligible for sale in the public market on May 18, 2013, and 426 million outstanding shares and 60 million shares issuable upon the exercise of an option held by Mark Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg has informed us that he has no intention to conduct any sale transactions in our securities until at least September 2013. If securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. The trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade the rating of our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price could decline. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of our Class A common stock increases. In addition, our credit facilities contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our Class A common stock may be negatively affected. We are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. In addition, beginning with our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed in 2014, we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are in the process of designing, implementing, and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, which process is time consuming, costly, and complicated.",

We are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into in July 2019 with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which is pending federal court approval and which, among other matters, will require us to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. Employees As of December 31, 2019, we had 44,942 employees. Corporate Information We were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Investment Risk As of December 31, 2015, our recorded basis in equity investments was $280 million. These investments primarily relate to equity-method and cost-method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. Item 8.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2015 (in millions, except percentages): As of December 31, 2015, we had $8.5 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions): The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2015. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2015, net sales from our International segment accounted for 33% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances.

Other Contingencies We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-party sellers.

                    "Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(4.3) billion, $(3.6) billion, and $(1.9) billion in 2013, 2012, and 2011, with the variability caused primarily by changes in capital expenditures, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments, and changes in cash paid for acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion, $3.8 billion, and $1.8 billion during 2013, 2012, and 2011. In December 2012, we acquired 11 buildings comprising 1.8 million square feet of our previously leased corporate office space and three city blocks in Seattle, Washington for $1.4 billion. Excluding this acquisition, increases in capital expenditures primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, including AWS, during all three periods. We expect this trend to continue over time. Capital expenditures included $493 million, $381 million, and $256 million for internal-use software and website development during 2013, 2012, and 2011. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2013, 2012, and 2011, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $312 million, $745 million, and $705 million. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(539) million, $2.3 billion, and $(482) million in 2013, 2012, and 2011. Cash outflows from financing activities result from common stock repurchases, payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, and repayments of long-term debt. Payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of long-term debt were $1.0 billion, $588 million, and $444 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $1.9 billion, $802 million, and $753 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, with the increases primarily reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, including AWS. We repurchased 5.3 million shares of common stock for $960 million in 2012 and 1.5 million shares of common stock for $277 million in 2011 under the $2.0 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2010. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $394 million, $3.4 billion, and $177 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011.",
                    "Cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to our repurchase of $100.0 million of common stock and our first-ever cash dividend payments of $46.9 million. These uses of cash were offset by cash proceeds of $64.9 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans and a non-cash tax benefit of $68.7 million related to employee stock-based compensation. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to cash proceeds of $195.9 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans and a non-cash tax benefit of $52.8 million related to employee stock-based compensation. Liquidity Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations. Our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises, money market funds and debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. As of January 27, 2013, we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities. All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d. Investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as \u201cavailable-for-sale,\u201d no gains or losses are realized in our statement of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be other-than-temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. As of January 27, 2013 and January 29, 2012, we had $3.73 billion and $3.13 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. As of January 27, 2013, we were in compliance with our investment policy. As of January 27, 2013, our investments in U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 56% of our total investment portfolio, while the financial sector accounted for approximately 19% of our total investment portfolio. All of our investments are with A/A2 or better rated securities. We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 27, 2013. Based on our quarterly impairment review, we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and did not record any impairment during fiscal year 2013. Net realized gains were $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $1.5 million for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.",
                    "Cash flow from operating activities during 2011 primarily resulted from net income of $1 billion, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $323 million, and share-based compensation expense of $217 million. Cash flow from operating activities during 2010 primarily resulted from net income of $606 million, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $139 million and share-based compensation expense of $20 million, partially offset by cash consumed by working capital of $70 million. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2012 primarily resulted from $4.87 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities, $1.24 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment, storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers as well as $911 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets, such as patents. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increases in the purchase of marketable securities, acquisitions of businesses and other assets, and capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities during 2011 primarily related to the use of approximately $2.4 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities. Our cash used in investing activities in 2011 also consisted of capital expenditures of $606 million related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment, storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers. Cash used in investing activities during 2010 primarily consisted of capital expenditures related to the purchases of property and equipment and the construction of data centers. Changes in restricted cash and deposits consumed $9 million of cash related to security deposits in support of real estate expansion in 2010. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, also consumed $22 million of cash in 2010. We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2013 of approximately $1.8 billion. Cash Provided by Financing Activities In May 2012, we received $6.8 billion in proceeds from our IPO, net of offering costs. Our financing activities have primarily consisted of equity issuances, lease financing, and debt financing. Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.28 billion and $1.2 billion, in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and included excess tax benefits from stock award activities of $1.03 billion and $433 million for the same periods, respectively. In 2012, our net cash provided by financing activities included the draw down of $1.5 billion from the Amended and Restated Term Loan. We did not have a loan draw down in 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we paid $2.86 billion of taxes related to the net settlement of RSUs when the Pre-2011 RSUs were vested and settled. In January 2011, we completed an offering of our Class A common stock to certain non-U.S. investors that generated $998 million in net proceeds. In December 2010, we completed an offering of our Class A common stock that generated $500 million in proceeds. In March 2010, we entered into a credit facility with certain lenders. This facility allowed for the draw down of up to $250 million in unsecured senior loans. In April 2010, we drew down the full amount available under the facility, and in March 2011, we repaid the entire $250 million balance. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2012. Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations under capital and operating leases for equipment and office and data center facilities.",
                    "Cash used in investing activities during 2012 of $48.2 billion consisted primarily of net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities of $38.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2012 of $1.7 billion consisted primarily of cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $2.5 billion. Capital Assets The Company\u2019s capital expenditures were $7.0 billion during 2013, consisting of $499 million for retail store facilities and $6.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. The Company\u2019s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2013 were $8.2 billion. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $11.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2014, including approximately $550 million for retail store facilities and approximately $10.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements. During 2014, the Company expects to open about 30 new retail stores, with approximately two-thirds located outside of the U.S. During 2014, the Company also expects to remodel approximately 20 of its existing stores. Long-Term Debt In the third quarter of 2013, the Company issued $17.0 billion of long-term debt, which included $3.0 billion of floating-rate notes. To manage the risk of adverse fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which, in effect, fixed the interest rate of the floating-rate notes. Of the aggregate principal amount of $17.0 billion, $2.5 billion is due in 2016 and $14.5 billion is due in 2018 through 2043. Dividend and Stock Repurchase Program In the third quarter of 2013, the Company raised its cash dividend by 15% to $3.05 per common share. The Company expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends of $3.05 per common share each quarter, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In 2012, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company\u2019s common stock. In April 2013, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $10 billion to $60 billion, of which $23.0 billion had been utilized as of September 28, 2013. The share repurchase program is expected to be completed by December 2015. The Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. Beginning in August 2012 through December 2015, the Company anticipates it will utilize approximately $100 billion to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights, repurchase shares, and remit withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units, of which $37.1 billion had been utilized through September 28, 2013.",
                    "Cash flow from operating activities during 2012 primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense of $1.57 billion and depreciation and amortization of $649 million, partially offset by income tax refundable of $451 million. The cash flow from operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 increased modestly as the increases in adjustments for non-cash items as described above were offset by a reduction in net income of $947 million and an increase in income tax refundable. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily resulted from $4.98 billion for the acquisition of businesses and $1.83 billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings, partially offset by $1.24 billion for the net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly due to increases in acquisitions of businesses and capital expenditures, partially offset by net sales of marketable securities.

The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increases in the purchase of marketable securities, the acquisition of businesses and other assets, and capital expenditures. We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2015 of approximately $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was $1.57 billion, which primarily resulted from $1.87 billion of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity, partially offset by $243 million of payments related to our capital lease transactions, and $73 million of tax payments related to net share settlement resulting mainly from the vested merger consideration of an acquisition. Cash used in financing activities during 2013 was $667 million, which primarily resulted from $1.50 billion for repayment of debt and $889 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement, partially offset by $1.48 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our follow-on equity offering in December 2013.

                    "Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and other facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. _______________________ (1) See \u201cResults of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. (2) Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people\u2019s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders\u2019 interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 504 million and 507 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2018. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends.",
                    "Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs. We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels and television advertising, as well as payroll and related expenses. While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content Technology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, production, maintenance, operation, and development of new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure costs. Content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising selection. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with expanding our products and services, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our AWS segment. Technology infrastructure costs consist of servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and payroll expenses. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for AWS service offerings globally, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Additionally, the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded infrastructure have increased over time, corresponding with increased usage. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure to support increased usage. The increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of existing product categories and service offerings, including AWS, and initiatives to introduce new product and service offerings.",
                    "Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2020 due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers, which will impact each of our segments. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business and Accounting Policies - Use of Estimates\u201d for additional information on the change in estimated useful life of our servers. Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased spending on marketing channels, as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $296 million and $201 million during 2018 and 2019, and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $440 million and $832 million during 2018 and 2019. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2018 and 2019. The increase is primarily related to finance leases. Our long-term lease liabilities were $9.7 billion and $39.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.",
                    "The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product, digital content, and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, as well as from expansion of digital offerings. Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows: Gross margin increased in 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods, primarily due to services sales increasing as a percentage of total sales. Services sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, and non-retail activities such as AWS, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. We believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and services sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs. We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We evaluate our facility requirements as necessary. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search programs and our Associates program, payroll and related expenses, and television advertising. While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as technology infrastructure, including AWS, expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services, as well as in technology infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure.",
                    "The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, costs from expanding our fulfillment network, and the COVID-19 related impact of lower productivity, increased employee hiring and benefits, and costs to maintain safe workplaces. We expect fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure, offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures - Use of Estimates\u201d for additional information on our change in estimated useful life of our servers. Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, partially offset by lower spending on marketing channels as a result of COVID-19. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees."

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics.\" Overview Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. Facebook enables you to express yourself and connect with the world around you instantly and freely. We build products that support our mission by creating utility for users, developers, and marketers: Users. We enable people who use Facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about. Developers. We enable developers to use the Facebook Platform to build applications (apps) and websites that integrate with Facebook to reach our global network of users and to build products that are more personalized and social. Marketers. We enable marketers to engage with more than one billion monthly active users (MAUs) on Facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. We offer marketers a unique combination of reach, relevance, social context, and engagement to enhance the value of their ads. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our Payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our Platform developers. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded revenue of $5.09 billion, income from operations of $538 million and net income of $53 million. Total costs and expenses increased 133% compared to revenue growth of 37% due to significant increases in share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses for restricted stock units (RSUs) and increases in headcount for the year ended December 31, 2012. During fiscal 2012, we recognized $1.72 billion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses. Of these amounts, $1.13 billion was due to the recognition of share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses related to RSUs granted prior to January 1, 2011 (Pre-2011 RSUs) triggered by the completion of our initial public offering (IPO) in May 2012. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 has exceeded the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and losses arising outside the United States in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit. Trends in Our User Metrics The numbers of MAUs, DAUs, and mobile MAUs discussed below, as well as average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include Instagram users unless such users would otherwise qualify as MAUs, DAUs and/or mobile MAUs based on activity that is shared back to Facebook. Monthly Active Users (MAUs).",

Various laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, such as the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Credit CARD Act, impose certain anti-money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services. Under these laws and regulations, financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters, check cashers, and sellers or issuers of stored value or prepaid access products. Requirements imposed on financial institutions under these laws include customer identification and verification programs, record retention policies and procedures, and transaction reporting. To increase flexibility in how our online payments infrastructure (Payments) may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the United States and an Electronic Money (E-Money) license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the European Economic Area, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws relating to money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, charitable fundraising, counter-terrorist financing, gambling, banking and lending, financial privacy and data security, and import and export restrictions.

The case was transferred to the Northern District of California in April 2017.

The case was ongoing as of the filing date.

Amazon disputed the assessment and intended to defend itself vigorously.

Additionally, the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment faced a 3% decline, attributed to decreased sales in wearables and accessories. These challenges were compounded by intensified competition from companies like Vivo and Huawei, which led to Apple losing its smartphone market leadership in China in 2024.

Our goal is a long-term, upward-bound career at Tesla for every employee, which we believe also drives our retention efforts. We also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe, respectful, fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business. From our outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions to sponsoring employee resource groups across numerous locations, including Asian Pacific Islanders at Tesla, Black at Tesla, Intersectionality, Latinos at Tesla, LGBTQ at Tesla, Veterans at Tesla and Women in Tesla, we engage these networks as key business resources and sources of actionable feedback.

                    "We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets. Solar Energy Systems The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems. Intellectual Property We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world. Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, our full-time count for our and our subsidiaries\u2019 employees worldwide was 70,757. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values. We want to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they become employees. Our efforts begin at the entry level with development, apprenticeship and internship programs in local high schools, community colleges and four-year colleges. In addition, we seek to hire based on talent rather than solely on educational pedigree, and have provided thousands of job openings, including in our local communities, for capable workers from various backgrounds to learn valuable skills in critical operations such as in manufacturing, vehicle service and energy product installation. We also emphasize in our evaluation and career development efforts internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development. Our goal is a long-term, upward-bound career at Tesla for every employee, which we believe also drives our retention efforts. We also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe, respectful, fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business. From our outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions to sponsoring employee resource groups across numerous locations, including Asian Pacific Islanders at Tesla, Black at Tesla, Intersectionality, Latinos at Tesla, LGBTQ at Tesla, Veterans at Tesla and Women in Tesla, we engage these networks as key business resources and sources of actionable feedback.",
                    "We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components, as well as our history of vehicle development and production, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition; however, we have a limited history of operations. Intellectual Property Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. Seasonality Sales of the Tesla Roadster have fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. We note that, in general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of Model S, Model X and other electric vehicles we introduce in the future may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. We do not expect our powertrain component sales and development services revenue to be impacted to a significant extent by seasonality. Segment Information We have determined that we operate as one reporting segment, which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles and electric powertrain components. For information regarding financial data by geographic areas, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Employees As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 2,964 full-time employees. None of our employees are currently represented by labor unions or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Available Information We file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K; proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Such reports, amendments, proxy statements and other information may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.

                    "Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13 million. We recognized settlement and legal expenses of $30 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for the settlement with the SEC relating to a take-private proposal for Tesla. These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018. Note 23 - Subsequent Events Early Conversions of Convertible Senior Notes Between January 1, 2021 and February 5, 2021, we have received additional conversion notices on our 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes for $62 million and $623 million in aggregate principal amounts, respectively, for which we intend to settle the principal amounts in cash during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Investments In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. We will account for digital assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition. We will perform an analysis each quarter to identify impairment. If the carrying value of the digital asset exceeds the fair value based on the lowest price quoted in the active exchanges during the period, we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference in the consolidated statement of operations. The cost basis of the digital assets will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increases in their quoted prices on the active exchanges. Gains (if any) will not be recorded until realized upon sale. Note 24 - Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited) The following table presents selected quarterly results of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except per share amounts): (1) Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.

Note 12 - Information about Geographic Areas We operate as one reportable segment which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage products. The following tables set forth total revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in thousands). Total Revenues Long-lived Assets Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases Our corporate headquarters and powertrain production operations are based in Palo Alto, California where we have leased a facility consisting of 350,000 square feet. This lease expires in January 2020. We lease a 203,772 square feet manufacturing facility in Tilburg, Netherlands through November 2023. We also lease a number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia for our office, retail and service locations as well as Supercharger sites under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through December 2030. Included within Operating Leases commitments in the table below are payments due under operating leases that have been accounted for as build-to-suit arrangements and are included in property, plant, and equipment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $68.2 million, $46.3 million and $21.5 million. Capital Leases We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases over terms between 36 and 60 months. The equipment under the leases are collateral for the lease obligations and are included within property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the categories of computer equipment and software and office furniture and equipment. Future minimum commitments for leases as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): Environmental Liabilities In connection with our Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California, we are obligated to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions existing at the time we purchased the property from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). Tesla is responsible for the first $15 million of remediation costs and any costs in excess of $30 million or costs incurred after the ten-year anniversary of closing. NUMMI is responsible for remediation costs between $15 million and $30 million for up to 10 years from the closing date. Through December 31, 2015, we have paid $6.94 million for remediation costs incurred related to the Fremont facility, effectively settling our accrued obligation and as of December 31, 2015, we have no accrued amounts remaining. As of December 31, 2014, we accrued a total of $4.0 million related to these environmental liabilities. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.",
                    "In 2014, we plan to significantly expand production capacity for Model S and Model X, invest in our customer support infrastructure, complete the development of Model X and start early design work on our third generation vehicle, which we refer to as \u201cGen III\u201d. Our research and development expenses in particular are expected to increase as design and engineering work accelerates on Model X. Our selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to grow in absolute terms as we expand our customer and corporate infrastructure globally. We have recently indicated our intention to build the Tesla Gigafactory, a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material, cell, module and battery pack production in one location. While we have not identified a final site for this facility, we currently expect that it will be located in one of the following states: Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico or Texas. We currently expect the facility to be built on a lot between 500 and 1,000 acres in size, with up to approximately 10 million square feet of production space with one or two levels. At full implementation, the Tesla Gigafactory is expected to have 6,500 dedicated Tesla and production partner employees. We currently plan to commence supplying battery packs manufactured at the Tesla Gigafactory for our vehicles, including the Gen III vehicle, and stationary storage applications, in approximately three years. The Tesla Gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020, which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500,000 vehicles annually and stationary storage applications. We believe that the Tesla Gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30% on a per kWh basis by the end of the first year of volume production of Gen III. The total capital expenditures associated with the Tesla Gigafactory through 2020 are expected to be $4-5 billion, of which approximately $2 billion is expected to come from Tesla. While our plan is to attempt to produce lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs for our Gen III vehicles at a new Tesla Gigafactory, our plans for such production are at a very early stage. We have no experience in the production of lithium-ion cells, and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell production and to date we have not formalized such partnerships. In addition, the cost of building and operating the Tesla Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the Tesla Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. During the third quarter of 2013, certain conditions with respect to the closing prices of our common stock in accordance with the terms of our Notes were met and accordingly, the Notes were convertible at the holder\u2019s option during the fourth quarter of 2013. Although these conditions were not met during the fourth quarter of 2013 and therefore the Notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014, should such closing price conditions be met in a future quarter, the Notes will be convertible by their holders during the immediately following quarter. Upon conversion of the Notes, we will be obligated to pay cash for the principal amount of the converted Notes and we may also have to deliver shares of our common stock in respect of such converted Notes. Any conversion of the Notes prior to their maturity or acceleration of the repayment of the Notes could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, results of operations and financial condition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.",

In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility located in Fremont, California from NUMMI, which is a joint venture between Toyota, and Motors Liquidation Company, the owner of selected assets of General Motors. In October 2010, we completed the purchase and received title to the facility and land (the Tesla Factory). The total cash paid was $42.0 million. The purchase totaled 210 acres, or approximately 55% of the land at the site, and included all of the manufacturing facilities located thereon totaling approximately 5.4 million square feet. We are required to comply with environmental regulations in connection with our Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. In October 2010, we and NUMMI amended the May 2010 purchase agreement to include the transfer to us of certain operating permits, or emission credits, for additional consideration of $6.5 million. We completed the transfer of these permits in October 2010. We commenced the production of our Model S vehicle and powertrain components and systems in June 2012 at the Tesla Factory. We also intend to build our future vehicles at the Tesla Factory. In July 2013, we completed the purchase of approximately 31 acres of land located in Fremont, California that is adjacent to the Tesla Factory for potential future expansion.

                    "Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $749.0 million and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Japanese yen. Our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities, proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings. Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products, increases in Model 3 production capacity at the Tesla Factory, the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai, the continued expansion of Gigafactory 1, the addition of manufacturing capacity for Model Y with the expectation to achieve volume production by the end of 2020, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet and Supercharger network. We currently expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.5 billion. In 2019, we will continue to utilize our increasing experience and learnings from past and current product ramps to do so at a level of capital efficiency per dollar of spend that we expect to be significantly greater than historical levels. For example, based on our experience with ramping Model 3 at the Tesla Factory, we expect that the capital spend per unit of Model 3 manufacturing capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai will be less than that of our line in Fremont. Likewise, based on such experience and the substantial commonality of components we expect between Model Y and Model 3, we believe that the production ramp of Model Y will be significantly faster than that of Model 3 and cost less per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of Model 3 at Fremont. Considering the pipeline of new products planned at this point, and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture cells, as well as considering all other infrastructure growth and expansion of Gigafactory 1, Gigafactory 2 and Gigafactory Shanghai, we currently estimate that capital expenditures will be between $2.5 to $3.0 billion annually for the next two fiscal years. Moreover, we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our near-term debt obligations (including the repayment of $920.0 million for our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due on March 1, 2019), although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources. For example, we expect that much of our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in China. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business. We have an agreement to spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory 2. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the State of New York, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months.

                    "Concurrent with our entering into the revolving credit facility, we also entered into a bridge credit facility agreement that allowed us to borrow up to $3 billion to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of RSUs in connection with our IPO. In October 2012, we amended and restated our bridge credit facility, converting it to an unsecured term loan facility (Amended and Restated Term Loan) that allowed us to borrow up to $1.5 billion to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of RSUs in connection with our IPO, with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at LIBOR plus 1.0%. We paid origination fees at closing of the Amended and Restated Term Loan, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. We drew down the $1.5 billion of the Amended and Restated Term Loan in October 2012 and paid an upfront fee of 0.15% on the loan amount, which fee is being amortized over the remaining term of the facility. Any amounts outstanding will become due and payable on October 25, 2015. In connection with the draw down of the Amended and Restated Term Loan, to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuation, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement. The net effect of this swap agreement is to convert the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 1.46%. The interest rate swap has a maturity date of October 25, 2015. As of December 31, 2012, our income tax refundable of $451 million reflects the expected refund from income tax loss carrybacks to 2010 and 2011. We expect to receive this refund in the first six months of 2013. As of December 31, 2012, $565 million of the $9.63 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have provided for the additional taxes that would be due if we repatriated these funds for use in our operations in the United States. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities during 2012 primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense of $1.57 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $649 million, partially offset by income tax refundable of $451 million. The cash flow from operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 increased modestly as the increases in adjustments for non-cash items as described above were offset by a reduction in net income of $947 million and an increase in income tax refundable. Cash flow from operating activities during 2011 primarily resulted from net income of $1 billion, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $323 million, and share-based compensation expense of $217 million. Cash flow from operating activities during 2010 primarily resulted from net income of $606 million, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $139 million and share-based compensation expense of $20 million, partially offset by cash consumed by working capital of $70 million. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2012 primarily resulted from $4.87 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities, $1.24 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment, storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers as well as $911 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets, such as patents.",
                    "These amounts are the aggregate of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was greater than the deferred tax assets that we recorded, reduced by any individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was less than the deferred tax assets that were recorded. These net amounts were recorded as an adjustment to stockholders' equity in each period, as an increase to cash flows from operating activities, and were not recognized in our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we reported excess tax benefits that decreased our cash flows from operating activities and increased our cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, by $1.87 billion, $609 million, and $1.03 billion, respectively. The amounts of these excess tax benefits reflect the total of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was greater than the deferred tax assets that were recorded, but were not reduced by any of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was less than the deferred tax assets that were recorded. Income Taxes We recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Advertising Expense Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $135 million, $117 million, and $67 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. We hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations. Our available-for-sale investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in stockholders' equity. Unrealized losses are charged against interest and other income/(expense), net when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. We have not recorded any such impairment charge in the periods presented.",
                    "These items collectively caused our annual effective tax rate to be higher than both the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective tax rates in 2011 and 2010. These items may also cause our effective tax rate in 2013 to be higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate. In 2011 and 2010, the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions offset the adverse impact of foreign jurisdiction losses and, as a result, the effective tax rate in both years was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As of December 31, 2012, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $89 million. We also have approximately $136 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. In January 2013, legislation was enacted to extend the federal research and development credit and other favorable tax benefits through December 31, 2013. As a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit for the research and development credit and other favorable tax benefits that were extended retroactively to January 1, 2012. Equity-Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax Equity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(155) million, $(12) million, and $7 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010. Details of the activity are provided below (in millions): Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of \u201cFree cash flow,\u201d operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to \u201cNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities,\u201d is cash flow from operations reduced by \u201cPurchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development.\u201d We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt, obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.",
                    "As of December 31, 2014, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $1.9 billion and we had approximately $443 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, which expired in 2014. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 11-Income Taxes\u201d for additional information. Equity-Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax Equity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $37 million, $(71) million, and $(155) million in 2014, 2013, and 2012. Details of the activity are provided below (in millions): ___________________ (1) Includes a $65 million gain related to LivingSocial\u2019s disposal of its Korean operations in the first quarter of 2014. Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): ___________________ (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.

Our measures of \u201cFree cash flow,\u201d operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flow, and ratios based on them, because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by \u201cPurchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development,\u201d which are included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, \u201cNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities,\u201d for 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in millions): Free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by \u201cPrincipal repayments of capital lease obligations,\u201d and \u201cPrincipal repayments of finance lease obligations,\u201d which are included in cash flow from financing activities.

In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been acquired with cash. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance principal lease repayments and capital acquired under capital leases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, \u201cNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities,\u201d for 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in millions): All of these free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.",
                    "Other Income (Expense), net Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and foreign currency translation. Other expense, net of other income was $1.0 million, $0.5 million, and $3.1 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The fluctuation between these years was primarily due to other than temporary impairment of our investment in the money market funds held by the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. that resulted in a charge of $5.6 million in fiscal year 2009, which was partially recovered in fiscal year 2011 for a gain of $3.0 million resulting from the final disbursement of this fund. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense (benefit) of $82.3 million, $18.0 million, and $(14.3) million during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Income tax expense (benefit) as a percentage of income (loss) before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 12.4% in fiscal year 2012, 6.7% in fiscal year 2011, and 17.4% in fiscal year 2010. Our effective tax rate on income or loss before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% due to income or loss earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the United States federal statutory tax rate of 35%, favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the U.S. federal research tax credit and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, excluding any discrete tax events that may occur, which, if realized, may increase or decrease our effective tax rate in such quarter. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 29, 2012, we had $3.13 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $639.0 million from the end of fiscal year 2011. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions which are required to follow our investment policy, which requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. Operating activities Operating activities generated cash of $909.2 million, $675.8 million and $487.8 million during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2012 when compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily due to an increase in our net income and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year 2011. For example, accounts payable increased as a result of the timing of payments to vendors and inventory decreased as a result of an increase in inventory turnover. Higher non-cash charges in earnings including stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. The cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2011 when compared to fiscal year 2010 primarily due to an increase in our net income and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year 2010."

                    "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Securities Litigation In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The claims were originally asserted by plaintiff Robert Rahimi, against Tesla and two of its executive officers, Elon Musk and Deepak Ahuja. On February 14, 2014, the Court granted the motion of Kazim Acar to serve as lead plaintiff, and gave him leave to file an amended complaint within 60 days. The current complaint seeks damages, attorney fees and other relief, and alleges, among other things, that Tesla made false and/or misleading representations and omissions including with respect to the safety of the Model S vehicle and Tesla\u2019s ability to meet public expectations with respect to its financial performance. The current complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of \u201call persons other than Defendants who purchased Tesla\u2019s securities between May 10, 2013 and November 6, 2013, inclusive.\u201d It is possible the amended complaint will modify the class or the class period. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend against it vigorously. Other Matters From time to time, we are subject to various other legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. PART II ITEM 5.",

This case was brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla\u2019s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On September 26, 2014, the trial court, upon the motion of Tesla and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and indicated that a formal written order will be forthcoming. Following the trial court\u2019s decision, Tesla and Mr. Musk brought a motion for sanctions against the plaintiffs, and that motion is currently pending. The plaintiffs have also appealed from the trial court\u2019s order, and that appeal is pending, as well. 12.

The consolidated lawsuit is captioned as In re Tesla Motors, Inc., Stockholders Litigation, C.A. No. 12711-VCS. It names as defendants the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors and alleges, among other things, that the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the SolarCity acquisition. It asserts claims derivatively on behalf of Tesla and directly on behalf of a putative class of Tesla stockholders. It seeks, among other relief, damages in an unspecified amount and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. After receiving the motion, plaintiffs indicated that they intend to file an amended complaint rather than respond to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.

                    "Fiscal Period The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\u2019s fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks and ended on September 30, 2017. A 14th week was included in the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2016 and 2015 ended on September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively, and spanned 52 weeks each. Fiscal 2017 Highlights Net sales increased 6% or $13.6 billion during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by growth in Services, iPhone and Mac. The year-over-year increase in net sales reflected growth in each of the geographic operating segments, with the exception of Greater China. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during 2017 compared to 2016. In May 2017, the Company announced an increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program from $250 billion to $300 billion through March 2019. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization from $175 billion to $210 billion and raising its quarterly dividend from $0.57 to $0.63 per share beginning in May 2017. During 2017, the Company spent $33.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $12.8 billion. Additionally, the Company issued $24.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated term debt, \u20ac2.5 billion of euro-denominated term debt and C$2.5 billion of Canadian dollar-denominated term debt during 2017. Fiscal 2016 Highlights Net sales declined 8% or $18.1 billion during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by a year-over-year decrease in iPhone net sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by an increase in Services. In April 2016, the Company announced an increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program from $200 billion to $250 billion through March 2018. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization from $140 billion to $175 billion and raising its quarterly dividend from $0.52 to $0.57 per share beginning in May 2016. During 2016, the Company spent $29.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $12.2 billion. Additionally, the Company issued $23.9 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated term debt and A$1.4 billion of Australian dollar-denominated term debt during 2016.

(2) Includes revenue from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services.

Fiscal 2015 Highlights Net sales rose 28% or $50.9 billion during 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a year-over-year increase in iPhone net sales. iPhone net sales and unit sales in 2015 increased in all of the Company\u2019s reportable operating segments.

Apple Watch, which launched during the third quarter of 2015, accounted for more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in net sales of Other Products. Net sales growth during 2015 was partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower iPad net sales. Total net sales increased in each of the Company\u2019s reportable operating segments, with particularly strong growth in Greater China where year-over-year net sales increased 84%.

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Overview and Highlights The Company designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u2019s products and services include iPhone\u00ae, iPad\u00ae, Mac\u00ae, iPod\u00ae, Apple Watch\u00ae, Apple TV\u00ae, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS\u2122, watchOS\u00ae and tvOS\u2122 operating systems, iCloud\u00ae, Apple Pay\u00ae and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store\u00ae, App Store\u00ae, Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store\u2122 and Apple Music\u00ae (collectively \u201cInternet Services\u201d). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. Fiscal 2016 Highlights Net sales declined 8% or $18.1 billion during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by a year-over-year decrease in iPhone net sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by an increase in Services. In April 2016, the Company announced a significant increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program from $200 billion to $250 billion through March 2018. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization from $140 billion to $175 billion and raising its quarterly dividend from $0.52 to $0.57 per share beginning in May 2016."

In November 2016, the Board authorized an additional $2.00 billion under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 251 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $5.5 billion through January 28, 2018. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 28, 2018, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.82 billion through December 2020. For fiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billion to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we may enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement.",
                    "(3) The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value for in-the-money options at January 31, 2016, based on the $29.29 closing price of our common stock on January 29, 2016. As of January 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015, there were 14 million and 25 million shares, respectively, of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $75 million, $62 million and $14 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Upon exercise of an option, we issue new shares of stock. The total fair value of options vested was $17 million, $33 million and $35 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 3 - Net Income Per Share The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes, or the Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share if their inclusion is dilutive. The Notes will generally have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.1204 per share. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, our average stock price exceeded the conversion price, causing the Notes to have a dilutive impact for this period. The denominator for diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge transaction, or the Note Hedges, that we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, as its effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event an actual conversion of any or all of the Notes occurs, the shares that would be delivered to us under the Note Hedges are designed to neutralize the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the Notes. The denominator for diluted net income per share will not include any effect from the warrants, which we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, unless our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted strike price of $27.0851 per share. Please refer to Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Notes. NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 4 - Goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill is as follows: The amount of goodwill allocated to our GPU and Tegra Processor segments was $210 million and $408 million, respectively, as of both January 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015. Please refer to Note 16 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding segments. We utilized a two-step quantitative analysis to complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and concluded that there was no impairment, as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value-based test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities."

                "answer": "An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies can impact NVIDIA's competitiveness in fiscal year 2023. Since NVIDIA's sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers are priced and paid in U.S. dollars, a stronger dollar could make their products more expensive in foreign markets, potentially reducing demand. Conversely, a weaker dollar might lead suppliers to raise their prices to maintain profit margins. To mitigate these effects, NVIDIA employs foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations. As of January 29, 2023, the notional value of these contracts was approximately $1.13 billion, with all designated contracts maturing within 18 months.

These complaints alleged price-fixing arrangements between Amazon and third-party sellers, monopolization, attempted monopolization, and consumer protection violations. The plaintiffs sought billions of dollars in damages and injunctive relief. Amazon disputed these allegations and intended to defend itself vigorously.

The complaint alleged that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringed on multiple U.S. patents related to video-on-demand content delivery systems. The case sought unspecified damages. Amazon disputed the allegations and intended to defend itself vigorously.

For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, alleging that Amazon should have collected these taxes on transactions by third-party sellers. Amazon appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals, believing the assessment was without merit and intending to defend itself vigorously.

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Please see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cItem 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company and Our Businesses NVIDIA is dedicated to advancing visual computing, enabling individuals to interact with digital ideas, data and entertainment with an ease and efficiency unmatched by any other communication medium. Our business model has three elements: creating NVIDIA-branded products and services, offering our processors to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and licensing our intellectual property. NVIDIA-branded products and services are visual computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, Enterprise, High Performance Computing & Cloud, and Automotive. Our two business segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying graphics architecture. In addition to the two reporting segments, the \u201cAll Other\u201d category primarily includes licensing revenue from our patent cross licensing agreement with Intel, which we expect to recognize through March 2017. GPUs, the engines of visual computing, are among the world's most complex processors. Our GPU product brands aimed at specialized markets include GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla for researchers, deep learning and big-data analysts; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. We also integrate our GPUs into tiny mobile chips called system-on-a-chip (SOC) processors, which power tablets, and automotive infotainment and safety systems. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, incorporating GPUs and multi-core CPUs with audio, video and input/output capabilities. They can also be integrated with baseband processors to add voice and data communication. Tegra conserves power while delivering state-of-the-art graphics and multimedia processing. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges GPU Business During fiscal year 2015, we announced and shipped GeForce GPUs based on our new Maxwell architecture and we surpassed fifty million installations of our GeForce Experience client, which provides game-ready drivers, optimized play settings, and streaming and sharing of gameplay. We also disclosed the first details of our Pascal GPU architecture, which will succeed Maxwell. Pascal is expected to feature 3D memory and NVLink interconnect technology. Quadro professional graphics continue to maintain market leadership. We refreshed our Quadro product lineup during fiscal year 2015 and also extended our product lineup to include Maxwell-based GPUs. We extended our reach in accelerated datacenter computing, with the world\u2019s fifteen most highly-efficient supercomputers all utilizing our Tesla GPUs. We continued to expand our reach in the big data analytics market, with IBM announcing future support for GPU acceleration in its IBM DB2 with BLU acceleration.",
                    "In fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies. The number of PSUs and market-based PSUs that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the Company\u2019s level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year. Please refer to Notes 1 and 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Revenue NVIDIA\u2019s products and services are built for three computing platforms - PC, datacenter/cloud, and mobile. For fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, approximately 72%, 77%, and 75% of our revenue, respectively, was associated with the PC computing platform, of which GPUs for the gaming and professional visualization markets comprised approximately 92%, 88%, and 80%, respectively, while PC OEM represented approximately 8%, 12%, and 20%, respectively. Revenue by Reportable Segments GPU Business. GPU business revenue increased by 39% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. This increase was due primarily to increased revenue from our GeForce GPU gaming and datacenter platforms. Sales of high-end GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 40%, reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and strong demand for our recent Pascal-based GPU products. Datacenter revenue, including our Tesla, NVIDIA GRID, and DGX-1 brands, increased 145%, reflecting strong demand for deep learning training for AI, cloud, accelerated, and virtualized computing, and initial DGX-1 sales. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 11% due primarily to higher sales in high end desktop and mobile workstation products. Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to last year. GPU business revenue increased by 9% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. This increase was due primarily to increased revenue from sales of high-end GeForce GPU products for gaming, which increased over 30% reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and increased sales of our Maxwell-based GPU products. Revenue from Tesla GPUs for Datacenter increased, driven by strong demand from hyperscale companies for deep learning for AI and accelerated computing. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization declined due to weakness in the overall workstation market. Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to the prior year. Tegra Processor Business.",

                    "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that could potentially exceed $1 million. We believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (\u201cBAAQMD\u201d) has issued notices of violation to us relating to air permitting and related compliance for the Fremont Factory, but has not initiated formal proceedings. We have disputed certain of these allegations and have asserted that there has been no related adverse community or environmental impact. While we have not yet resolved this matter, we remain in close communication with BAAQMD with respect to it. We do not currently expect any material adverse impact on our business. The German Umweltbundesamt has issued our subsidiary in Germany a notice and fine in the amount of 12 million euro alleging its non-compliance under applicable laws relating to market participation notifications and take-back obligations with respect to end-of-life battery products required thereunder. This is primarily relating to administrative requirements, but Tesla has continued to take back battery packs, and although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, including the final amount of any penalties, we have filed our objection and it is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business. We have also received a follow-up information request from the EPA under Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act of 1963, as amended (the \u201cClean Air Act\u201d). The EPA is reviewing the compliance of our Fremont Factory operations with applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act, and we are working with the EPA in responding its requests for information. While the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business. ITEM 4.",
                    "In addition, any potential tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently offset with a full valuation allowance. Note 12 - Information about Geographic Areas We operate as one reportable segment which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage products. The following tables set forth total revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in thousands). Total Revenues Long-lived Assets Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases Our corporate headquarters and powertrain production operations are based in Palo Alto, California where we have leased a facility consisting of 350,000 square feet. This lease expires in January 2020. We lease a 203,772 square feet manufacturing facility in Tilburg, Netherlands through November 2023. We also lease a number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia for our office, retail and service locations as well as Supercharger sites under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through December 2030. Included within Operating Leases commitments in the table below are payments due under operating leases that have been accounted for as build-to-suit arrangements and are included in property, plant, and equipment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $68.2 million, $46.3 million and $21.5 million. Capital Leases We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases over terms between 36 and 60 months. The equipment under the leases are collateral for the lease obligations and are included within property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the categories of computer equipment and software and office furniture and equipment. Future minimum commitments for leases as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): Environmental Liabilities In connection with our Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California, we are obligated to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions existing at the time we purchased the property from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). Tesla is responsible for the first $15 million of remediation costs and any costs in excess of $30 million or costs incurred after the ten-year anniversary of closing. NUMMI is responsible for remediation costs between $15 million and $30 million for up to 10 years from the closing date. Through December 31, 2015, we have paid $6.94 million for remediation costs incurred related to the Fremont facility, effectively settling our accrued obligation and as of December 31, 2015, we have no accrued amounts remaining. As of December 31, 2014, we accrued a total of $4.0 million related to these environmental liabilities. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.",
                    "We need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations, ramp vehicle production, continue research and development projects, establish sales, delivery and service centers, build and deploy Superchargers, expand Gigafactory 1, ramp production at Gigafactory 2, build and commence Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicles, energy storage products and solar products. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, we use capital from third-party investors to enable our customers\u2019 access to our solar energy systems with little or no upfront cost. The availability of this financing depends upon many factors, including the confidence of the investors in the solar energy industry, the quality and mix of our customer contracts, any regulatory changes impacting the economics of our existing customer contracts, changes in law (including tax law), risks or government incentives associated with these financings, and our ability to compete with other renewable energy companies for the limited number of potential investors. Moreover, while interest rates remain at low levels, they have risen in recent periods. If the rate of return required by investors rises as a result of a rise in interest rates, it will reduce the present value of the customer payment streams underlying, and therefore the total value of, our financing structures, increasing our cost of capital. If we are unable to establish new financing funds on favorable terms for third-party ownership arrangements, we may be unable to finance the installation of our solar energy systems for our lease or PPA customers\u2019 systems, or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity may be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings. We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Aside from the settlement with the SEC discussed below relating to Elon Musk\u2019s statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the DOJ, or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings. For example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr. Musk\u2019s statement on August 7, 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Pursuant to the settlement, we, among other things, paid a civil penalty of $20 million, appointed an independent director as the Chair of the Board, appointed two additional independent directors to the Board, and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters. Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us.",
                    "Briefs were filed on May 13, 2020 and May 15, 2020 and a hearing was held on May 19, 2020. Defendants again prevailed, with the Court denying plaintiffs\u2019 request to lift the stay and for an expedited trial. The plaintiffs also sought leave to file an amended complaint, which was granted. The Court entered an order implementing its ruling on May 21, 2020. The amended complaint asserts additional allegations of breach of fiduciary duty related to two additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, dated July 29, 2019 and May 1, 2020, and seeks unspecified damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits. Certain Investigations and Other Matters We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests. In particular, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with (a) Elon Musk\u2019s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private and (b) certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and other public statements relating to Model 3 production. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. On December 4, 2019, the SEC (i) closed the investigation into the projections and other public statements regarding Model 3 production rates and (ii) issued a subpoena seeking information concerning certain financial data and contracts including Tesla\u2019s regular financing arrangements. Separately, the DOJ had also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about the above matters related to taking Tesla private and Model 3 production rates. Aside from the settlement, as amended, with the SEC relating to Mr. Musk\u2019s statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, there have not been any developments in these matters that we deem to be material, and to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with government authorities. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, and financial position. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position, and brand. Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from reductions in investment tax credits claimed under U.S. federal laws for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a co-sited solar power facility (\u201cITC\u201ds). Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy systems as assessed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) for purposes of claiming ITCs.",

(\u201cTesla\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. As of and following December 31, 2020, there has continued to be widespread impact from the coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic. In 2020, we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of the year. Some of our suppliers and partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming, including Panasonic, which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory Nevada. We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations were scaled back. Finally, reduced operations or closures at motor vehicle departments, vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors resulted in challenges in or postponements for our new vehicle deliveries, used vehicle sales, and energy product deployments. By the second half of 2020, however, we resumed operations at all of our manufacturing facilities and have continued to increase our output and add additional capacity and work with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production. On the other hand, certain government regulations and shifting social behaviors have continued to limit or close non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions."

Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition, stock repurchase, cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include: \u2022 decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers\u2019 products; \u2022 inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products; \u2022 competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and \u2022 new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. We expect to spend approximately $240.0 million to $280.0 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2014, primarily for property development, leasehold improvements, software licenses, emulation equipment, computers and engineering workstations. In fiscal year 2014, we expect to break ground on a new building for our headquarters campus in Santa Clara to provide for our near-term growth needs. This 500,000 square foot building will provide 2,500 seats and be built on land we purchased five years ago.",

                    "Additionally, we have not in the past, and do not currently, offer customary discounts on our vehicles like most of our competitors do. We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile, which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results. Volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods. For example, according to automotive industry sources, sales of passenger vehicles in North America during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30% lower than those during the same period in the prior year. Demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we currently or will sell our electric vehicles, such as Europe and Asia, will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles, such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers. Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to the seasonality of our business, fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors. Our operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to many factors, including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles. Demand for new cars in the automobile industry typically declines over the winter season, while sales are generally higher during the spring and summer months. Sales of the Tesla Roadster fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters.",
                    "Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. Furthermore, certain large automobile manufacturers offer financing and leasing options on their vehicles and also have the ability to market vehicles at a substantial discount, provided that the vehicles are financed through their affiliated financing company. While we have entered into a preliminary agreement with Athlon Car Lease for the leasing of Model S in selected European and Nordic countries, we do not currently offer any lease financing on Model S, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to large automobile manufacturers. We have not in the past, and do not currently, offer customary discounts on our vehicles. Additionally, the lack of lease financing and the absence of customary vehicle discounts could put us at a competitive disadvantage. We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms.

                    "We may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs. Others, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses, and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights. We may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign our products and services, and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we were required to take one or more such actions, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention. Tesla is a highly-visible public company whose products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are often scrutinized by critics whose influence could negatively impact the perception of our brand and the market value of our common stock. Tesla is a highly-visible public company whose products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are well-publicized. Such attention includes frequent criticism of us by a range of third-parties. Our continued success depends on our ability to focus on executing on our mission and business plan while maintaining the trust of our current and potential customers, employees, stockholders and business partners. Any negative perceived actions of ours could influence the perception of our brand or our leadership by our customers, suppliers or investors, which could adversely impact our business prospects, operating results and the market value of our common stock. Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters. Our corporate headquarters, the Tesla Factory and Gigafactory 1 are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada. If major disasters such as earthquakes or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced an intra-day trading high of $387.46 per share and a low of $244.59 per share over the last 52 weeks. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.",
                    "These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers. Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to the seasonality of our business, fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors. Our operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to many factors, including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles. Demand for new cars in the automobile industry typically declines over the winter season, while sales are generally higher during the spring and summer months. Sales of the Tesla Roadster fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. We note that, in general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of Model S and future models may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Also, any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles. Our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue. In addition, we expect our period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture Model X and future products, increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce vehicles at higher volumes, develop the Tesla Gigafactory, open new Tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities, open new Supercharger locations, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results, especially in the short-term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time. If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts and within our industry, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and stock price may suffer materially. Our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years from now, buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support. As a result, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. If we are required to curtail our expansion plans in the future as we have done in the past, this may result in negative perceptions regarding our long-term business prospects and may lead to cancellations of Model S or Model X orders and reservations. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts and other parties in our liquidity and long-term business prospects.",

These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers. Difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer purchases of luxury items, such as our performance electric vehicles. Over the last few years, the deterioration in the global financial markets and continued challenging condition of the macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted consumer spending and we believe has adversely affected the sales of our Tesla Roadster. The automobile industry in particular was severely impacted by the poor economic conditions and several vehicle manufacturing companies, including General Motors and Chrysler, were forced to file for bankruptcy. Sales of new automobiles generally have dropped during this recessionary period. Sales of high-end and luxury consumer products, such as our performance electric vehicles, depend in part on discretionary consumer spending and are even more exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions. Difficult economic conditions could therefore temporarily reduce the market for vehicles in our price range. Discretionary consumer spending also is affected by other factors, including changes in tax rates and tax credits, interest rates and the availability and terms of consumer credit. If the current difficult economic conditions continue or worsen, we may experience a decline in the demand for reservations for Model S or future vehicles such as Model X, any of which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Accordingly, any events that have a negative effect on the United States economy or on foreign economies or that negatively affect consumer confidence in the economy, including disruptions in credit and stock markets, and actual or perceived economic slowdowns, may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We plan to grow our sales in Europe and Asia in 2013 and beyond. If there is a significant slowdown and continued downturn in the European economy, our prospects of growth in Europe could be severally constrained. Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to the seasonality of our business and fluctuations in our operating costs. Our operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to many factors, including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles.

To mitigate this, the company entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge against risks associated with certain assets, liabilities, forecasted cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These hedges typically covered portions of forecasted foreign currency exposure for up to 12 months. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312515356351/d17062d10k.htm?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Interest Rate Risk**: Apple's exposure to interest rate changes primarily affected its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. To manage this risk, the company utilized interest rate swaps to convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or vice versa. As of September 29, 2018, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have led to an annualized increase of $399 million in interest expense on the company's debt.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California February 26, 2015 Tesla Motors, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Overview of the Company Tesla Motors, Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia. The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to market, manufacture, sell and/or service our vehicles. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we began separately presenting the effect of exchange rate changes on our cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statements of cash flows due to our growing operations in foreign currency environments. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period, including revenue recognition, residual value of operating lease vehicles, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of financial instruments, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions, and stock-based compensation. Given the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting update which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The new guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized.",

While fluctuations in interest rates did not impact the company's consolidated financial statements due to the amortized cost accounting of its debt, the fair value of this debt, which pays a fixed interest rate, was subject to change with interest rate movements. Specifically, the fair value would increase during periods of declining interest rates and decrease when rates rose. Additionally, Amazon invested excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment-grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. A rise in interest rates could adversely affect the fair market value of these fixed income securities, potentially leading to principal losses if the company was compelled to sell them during such periods.

([about.fb.com](https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/update-on-security-issue/?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **September 2018 Photo API Bug**: A bug in Facebook's photo API exposed private photos of up to 6.8 million users to third-party app developers. This included photos shared on Marketplace, Facebook Stories, and unposted photos. ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/facebook-photo-bug/?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **2018 Bug Bounty Program**: Facebook's bug bounty program paid out over $1.1 million in 2018, addressing more than 700 valid reports from researchers worldwide.

Price Range of Common Stock The price range per share of common stock presented below represents the highest and lowest intraday sales prices for the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq during each quarter of the two most recent years. Holders As of October 20, 2017, there were 25,333 shareholders of record. Dividends The Company paid a total of $12.6 billion and $12.0 billion in dividends during 2017 and 2016, respectively, and expects to pay quarterly dividends of $0.63 per common share each quarter, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. The Company also plans to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 18 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers Share repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2017 was as follows (in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts): (1) In May 2017, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors increased the Company\u2019s share repurchase authorization from $175 billion to $210 billion of the Company\u2019s common stock, of which $166 billion had been utilized as of September 30, 2017. The remaining $44 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of September 30, 2017. The Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In May 2017, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement (\u201cASR\u201d) to purchase up to $3.0 billion of the Company\u2019s common stock. In August 2017, the purchase period for this ASR ended and an additional 4.5 million shares were delivered and retired. In total, 20.1 million shares were delivered under this ASR at an average repurchase price of $149.20. (3) In August 2017, the Company entered into a new ASR to purchase up to $3.0 billion of the Company\u2019s common stock. In exchange for an up-front payment of $3.0 billion, the financial institution party to the arrangement committed to deliver shares to the Company during the ASR\u2019s purchase period, which will end in November 2017. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock during that period.

                    "If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the second quarter of 2015, we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from October 1 to April 1. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. During the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of April 1, 2015, would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill. Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the fair value measurement through our weighted-average cost of capital that we use to determine a discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are short-term in nature or a longer-term trend. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill for impairment. Changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2015 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stock-based compensation. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future.",

Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. We conduct our annual impairment test as of October 1 of each year, and have determined there to be no impairment for any of the periods presented. There were no triggering events identified from the date of our assessment through December 31, 2014 that would require an update to our annual impairment test. See \u201cNote 4-Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.\u201d Other Assets Included in \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of amortization; acquired digital media content, net of amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; intellectual property rights, net of amortization; and equity warrant assets. Content Costs We obtain video and music content to be made available to Prime members through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions and generally have terms from one to five years with fixed payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and available for streaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee per title and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset as cost of sales on a straight-line basis over each title\u2019s contractual window of availability, which typically ranges from six months to five years. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original content. The production costs of internally developed content are capitalized only if persuasive evidence exists that the production will generate revenue. Because we have limited history to support the economic benefits of our content, we have generally expensed such costs as incurred. As we develop more experience or otherwise obtain the necessary evidence that future revenue will be earned through licensing or Prime membership activity, a portion of future production costs may be capitalized. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Such investments are included in \u201cCash and cash equivalents,\u201d or \u201cMarketable securities\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, classified as available-for-sale, and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss.\u201d Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. The total of our investments in equity-method investees, including identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax liabilities, and goodwill, is included within \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.",

Our share of the net income or loss of our equity method investees includes operating and non-operating gains and charges, which can have a significant impact on our reported equity-method investment activity and the carrying value of those investments. We regularly evaluate these investments, which are not carried at fair value, for other-than-temporary impairment. We also consider whether our equity method investments generate sufficient cash flows from their operating or financing activities to meet their obligations and repay their liabilities when they come due. We record purchases, including incremental purchases, of shares in equity-method investees at cost. Reductions in our ownership percentage of an investee, including through dilution, are generally valued at fair value, with the difference between fair value and our recorded cost reflected as a gain or loss in our equity-method investment activity. In the event we no longer have the ability to exercise significant influence over an equity-method investee, we would discontinue accounting for the investment under the equity method.",

Our estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 27%. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. For example, over 50% of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions."

                    "Beginning in 2014, Tesla began offering resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain financing institutions. As Tesla has guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are expected to be leased to end-customers, we account for them as collateralized borrowings. At December 31, 2014, we have $19.6 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantee liability of which a portion will be accreted to revenue and a portion may be distributed to the financing institutions should we decide to repurchase the vehicles at the end of the term or should the financing institution sell the car to a third party and receive proceeds less than the value we have guaranteed. The maximum cash payment to re-purchase these vehicles under these arrangements at December 31, 2014, is $11.2 million. Cash received upon the sale of such cars is classified as collateralized lease borrowing within cash flows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Account activity related to our resale value guarantee program consisted of the following for the period presented (in thousands): Model S Leasing Program In April 2014, we began offering a leasing program in the United States and Canada for Model S. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a Model S for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term of the individual leases and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales over the same period. As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred $9.4 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in automotive sales and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $4.4 million. Regulatory Credits Sales California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn regulatory credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to GHG emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, such as ZEV and GHG credits on vehicles, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future. We enter into contractual agreements with third parties to purchase our regulatory credits. We recognize revenue on the sale of these credits at the time legal title to the credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Revenue from the sale of regulatory credits totaled $216.3 million, $194.4 million, and $40.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Maintenance and Service Plans We offer a prepaid maintenance program for Model S, which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles, provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time. The maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts, excluding tires and the battery, with either a fixed fee per visit for Tesla Ranger service or unlimited Tesla Ranger visits for a higher initial purchase price.",
                    "Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Car sales include certain standard features and customer selected options and configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance, including internet connectivity, Supercharging access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with Autopilot hardware. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is generally the eight-year life of the car or, for software upgrades, as they are delivered. If we sell a derivable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options, costs used to develop and deliver the service, and other information which may be available. As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred $25.6 million related to access to our Supercharger network and $14.4 million related to connectivity. At the time of revenue recognition, we record a reserve against revenue for estimated future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. Resale Value Guarantee We offer a resale value guarantee program to customers who purchase a Model S and finance their vehicle through one of our commercial banking partners in the US, Canada and Europe. Under this program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period from 36 to 39 months after delivery for a specified value determined at time of purchase. Because we offer a resale value guarantee, we account for these transactions as operating leases. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period to automotive sales revenue. Similarly, we capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value, less expected salvage value, to cost of automotive sales over the same period. At the end of the guarantee period, which is the earlier of 39 months or the pay-off date of the initial loan, the resale value guarantee and deferred revenue balances are settled to automotive sales revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive sales if our customer retains ownership of the car. In cases where a customer returns the vehicle back to us between months 36 and 39, we issue a check to the customer in the amount of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive sales revenue. At least annually, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of Model S, there may be significant changes to their estimated values. Beginning in 2014, Tesla began offering resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain financing institutions. As Tesla has guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are expected to be leased to end-customers, we account for them as collateralized borrowings. At December 31, 2014, we have $19.6 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantee liability of which a portion will be accreted to revenue and a portion may be distributed to the financing institutions should we decide to repurchase the vehicles at the end of the term or should the financing institution sell the car to a third party and receive proceeds less than the value we have guaranteed. The maximum cash payment to re-purchase these vehicles under these arrangements at December 31, 2014, is $11.2 million.",
                    "We have had net losses on a GAAP basis in each quarter since our inception, except for the first quarter of 2013. Even if we are able to continue to increase Model S production and sales and begin to produce and sell Model X and future vehicles, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable. In order to achieve profitability as well as long-term commercial success, we must continue to achieve our planned cost reductions, control our operational costs while producing quality vehicles, increase our production rate, maintain strong demand in North America, and grow demand abroad in Europe and Asia. Failure to do one or more of these things could prevent us from achieving sustained, long-term profitability. Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar could harm our financial results. Our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched. As we have increased Model S deliveries in markets outside of the United States, we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro, Norwegian kroner, and Chinese yuan. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar therefore has reduced, and any further strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to further reduce, our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. As a result, our operating results could be adversely affected. The introduction of our resale value guarantee and leasing programs may result in lower revenues and profits and exposes us to resale risk to the extent many customers elect to return their vehicles to us and the residual values are lower than our estimates. In 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and Canada and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. In April and October of 2014, we started offering leasing to business customers and individual customers, respectively, including through Tesla Finance, our captive finance company. Both the resale value guarantee program and leasing offered through Tesla Finance generate lower revenues in the period the car is delivered as compared to cash purchases and both expose us to the risk that any vehicles repurchased or returned to us under the programs may be resold by us for prices less than we estimate. Under the resale value guarantee program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a pre-determined resale value. As a result of this resale value guarantee and customers having the option of selling their vehicles to us, we apply lease accounting to such purchases, which defers the recognition of the associated revenues over time instead of full recognition at vehicle delivery. Although the resale value guarantee does not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery, a significant uptake under this program could have a significant adverse impact on our near term GAAP revenues and operating results. Under the leasing program offered through Tesla Finance, we lease vehicles directly to customers. Customers have the option of purchasing their vehicles at the stated value in the leasing contract or returning their vehicles to us. We apply lease accounting to such purchases. Unlike the resale value guarantee program, we may receive only a very small portion of the price of the vehicle from our customers at the time of purchase, and instead will receive a stream of lease payments.",
                    "Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue. The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was $742.9 million and $855.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, including $411.6 million within a 12-month period from December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $1.64 billion and $1.18 billion of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees and $339.5 million and $289.1 million recorded in deferred revenue liability, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a total of $26.2 million and $57.0 million, respectively, in accounts receivable from our leasing partners. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Activity related to our resale value guarantee and similar programs consisted of the following (in thousands): Direct Vehicle Leasing Program We offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the North America and Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases, and we recognize leasing revenues on a straight-line basis over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had deferred $96.6 million and $67.2 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in automotive leasing revenue, and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $220.6 million, $112.7 million and $41.2 million, respectively. Regulatory Credits California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero-emission vehicles. These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles may earn regulatory credits (\u201cZEV credits\u201d) and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers.",
                    "Given this plan, we continue to invest heavily in capital expenditures. Our capital expenditure needs include expenditures for the tooling, production equipment and construction of the Model 3 production lines, equipment to support cell production at the Gigafactory 1, as well as new retail locations, service centers and Supercharger locations. We expect to invest between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production in 2017. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net book value of our Supercharger network was $207.2 million and $166.6 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2016, our Supercharger network included 790 locations globally. We plan to continue investing in our Supercharger network for the foreseeable future, including in North America, Europe and Asia, and expect such spending to continue to be a minimal portion of total capital spending. During 2017, we expect that this investment will grow our Supercharger network greatly. We allocate Supercharger related expenses to cost of total automotive revenues and selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs were immaterial for all periods presented. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2017, driven by engineering, design, and testing expenses related to Model 3, supplier contracts and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence. In addition, we expect operating expenses to increase as a result of the increased selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our energy generation and storage segment. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure. Over time, we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. Automotive Financing Options We offer loans and leases for our vehicles in certain markets in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions. During 2016, we discontinued the resale value guarantee in North America, but continue to offer it in selected European and Asian markets. Resale value guarantees available for exercise during fiscal year 2017 total $179.5 million in value. Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates, or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows. Based on current market demand for our cars, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts. Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted materially. We currently offer vehicle leases in the U.S. directly from Tesla Finance, our captive financing entity, as well as through a leasing partner. Leasing through Tesla Finance is now available in 39 states and the District of Columbia."
