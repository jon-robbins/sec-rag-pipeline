    "source_text": "The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016. Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars."

    "question": "How might employee travel restrictions affect the Company in fiscal year 2023?",
    "answer": "Employee travel restrictions could adversely affect the Company by limiting the movement of products, causing delays in production ramps of new products, and impacting the delivery of products to customers.",
    "source_text": "Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u2019s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers."
