A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a richer product mix resulting from stronger sales of our GeForce GPU products for gaming and lower sales of GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs."

([contracts.justia.com](https://contracts.justia.com/companies/nvidia-corporation-978/contract/158705/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Action by Stockholders**: Stockholder actions required a duly called meeting, not written consent, potentially delaying or preventing rapid changes in control. ([contracts.justia.com](https://contracts.justia.com/companies/nvidia-corporation-978/contract/158705/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Amendment of Bylaws**: Amending the bylaws required a two-thirds majority vote, making it difficult for shareholders to alter governance structures. ([contracts.justia.com](https://contracts.justia.com/companies/nvidia-corporation-978/contract/158705/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Special Meetings**: Special meetings could only be called by the Chairman, CEO, or a majority of directors, limiting shareholders' ability to initiate meetings. ([contracts.justia.com](https://contracts.justia.com/companies/nvidia-corporation-978/contract/158705/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Preferred Stock Issuance**: The board could issue preferred stock with rights that might deter hostile takeovers.

Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Additionally, any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.",
                "As a result, in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 shipments of PCs by some PC manufacturers were reduced, which reduced the demand for our GPUs. In addition, higher disk-drive prices constrained the ability of some PC manufacturers to include a GPU in their systems which also reduced demand for our GPUs and negatively impacted our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. A decline in demand in certain end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations. Our customer base includes companies in a wide range of end-user markets, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications-and computer-related industries."

The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.
