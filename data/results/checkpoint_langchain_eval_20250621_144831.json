Offsetting this increase were the absence of both a $20.1 million charge for a charitable contribution and a charge of $3.1 million for a class action settlement that we recorded in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal Year 2013 vs. Fiscal Year 2012 Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $25.2 million, or 6%, year over year. This increase was primarily due to a $21.6 million increase in compensation and benefits expense as we continue to invest in our business. Also contributing to the increase was a $20.1 million expense for the net present value of a charitable contribution that we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Offsetting these increases were decreases in outside professional fees of $10.4 million due to an overall decrease in professional services costs during fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 due to a general decline in litigation-related costs and the absence of services associated with acquisition activity in fiscal year 2013. Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Interest income was $17.1 million, $19.9 million and $19.1 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2014 from the prior year was primarily due to the result of lower average cash balances as we liquidated a portion of our investment portfolio to fund an accelerated share repurchase transaction during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. Interest expense was $10.4 million, $3.3 million, and $3.1 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase from prior year is attributable to $2.5 million for coupon interest and $4.6 million for debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes. We expect to incur annual coupon interest expense of $15.0 million, and annual debt discount amortization of $28.0 million, for fiscal year 2015. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sale of investment in non-affiliated companies, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Net other income (expense) was $7.4 million, $(2.8) million and $(1.0) million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in other income for fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to an increase in gains from foreign currency remeasurements and a gain of $3.1 million from sale of a non-affiliated investment. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $70.3 million, $99.5 million and $82.3 million during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 13.8%, 15.0%, and 12.4% in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.", "Amortization of our intangible assets in 2015 also increased $100 million compared to 2014, mostly due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014. 2014 Compared to 2013.

These increases were partially offset by items related to data center lease abandonment: we reversed $34 million of lease abandonment expense in 2014 due to our decision to re-occupy and utilize a previously exited data center, compared to a recognition of $117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013. In 2016, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services. Research and development 2015 Compared to 2014. Research and development expenses in 2015 increased $2.15 billion, or 81%, compared to 2014. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $1.02 billion compared to 2014, which reflected the full year impact of share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014. In addition, other payroll and benefits expense increased as a result of a 43% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 in engineering and other technical functions. 2014 Compared to 2013. Research and development expenses in 2014 increased $1.25 billion, or 88%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $724 million in share-based compensation expense compared to 2013, and an increase in other payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 48% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 in engineering and other technical functions. Share-based compensation expense also increased due to the acquisitions we completed in 2014. In 2016, we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees and increasing our investment to support our research and development initiatives. Marketing and sales 2015 Compared to 2014. Marketing and sales expenses in 2015 increased $1.05 billion, or 62%, compared to 2014. The majority of the increase was due to increases in amortization of our intangible assets of $305 million due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014, and in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 32% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 in our marketing and sales functions. Additionally, our marketing expenses increased $258 million in 2015, compared to 2014. 2014 Compared to 2013. Marketing and sales expenses in 2014 increased $683 million, or 69%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 44% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 in our marketing and sales functions. Our marketing expenses also increased $150 million in 2014, compared to 2013. Additionally, share-based compensation expense also increased $116 million compared to 2013.", "The increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, including AWS, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of products and services. For 2015, 2014, and 2013, we capitalized $642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation), $641 million (including $104 million of stock-based compensation), and $581 million (including $87 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $635 million, $559 million, and $451 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2015, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation was $2.1 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.1 billion during 2015, 2014, and 2013. The increase in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in the number of stock-based compensation awards granted to existing and new employees. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $171 million, $133 million, and $114 million during 2015, 2014, and 2013, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. Income from Operations For the reasons discussed above, income from operations increased to $2.2 billion in 2015, from $178 million in 2014 and $745 million in 2013. We believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $50 million, $39 million, and $38 million during 2015, 2014, and 2013. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $459 million, $210 million, and $141 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013. The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-term debt, and capital and finance lease arrangements. Our long-term debt was $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our other long-term liabilities were $9.9 billion and $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Note 6-Other Long-Term Liabilities\u201d for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $(256) million, $(118) million, and $(136) million during 2015, 2014, and 2013. The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign-currency gains (losses).", "Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Interest income was $28.1 million, $17.1 million and $19.9 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to higher average cash balances as we invested the proceeds from the convertible notes we issued in December 2013 in interest bearing securities. The decrease in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the result of lower average cash balances as we liquidated a portion of our investment portfolio to fund an accelerated share repurchase transaction during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. Interest expense was $46.1 million, $10.4 million and $3.3 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increases in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 compared to fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, were primarily due to coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes we issued in December 2013. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-affiliated companies, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Net other income (expense) was $13.9 million, $7.4 million and $(2.8) million in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a non-affiliated investment, partially offset by the recognition of an impairment loss of a non-affiliated investment during the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and losses from foreign currency remeasurement. The increase in other income for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to an increase in gains from foreign currency remeasurements and a gain from the sale of a non-affiliated investment. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $124.2 million, $70.3 million and $99.5 million during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 16.5%, 13.8%, and 15.0% in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal year 2015 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014. Our effective tax rate on income before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% due to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate is lower, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit and release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits. Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.", "The decrease was primarily due to a $208 million decrease in share-based compensation expense in 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease in 2013 was partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 19% increase in employee headcount and increased amortization of acquired patents. In 2015, we plan to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support overall company growth. Interest and other income/(expense), net 2014 Compared to 2013. Interest and other income/(expense), net in 2014 decreased $34 million, or 68%, compared to 2013. Other income/(expense), net decreased primarily due to $87 million in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. The decrease in other income/(expense), net was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of our long-term debt in August 2013 and lower capital lease payments. 2013 Compared to 2012. Interest and other income/(expense), net in 2013 decreased $6 million, or 14%, compared to 2012. Other income/(expense), net decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. In addition, interest expense increased by $5 million primarily due to interest on the $1.5 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012 and fully repaid in August 2013, offset by an increase in interest income resulting from higher invested cash balances. Provision for income taxes 2014 Compared to 2013. Our provision for income taxes in 2014 increased $716 million, or 57%, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to non-deductible share-based compensation, operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S., and tax research credits. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a change in our geographic mix of pre-tax income. 2013 Compared to 2012. Our provision for income taxes in 2013 increased $813 million, or 184%, compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a lower amount of non-deductible share-based compensation. Our effective tax rate in 2013 was also lower due to the reinstatement in 2013 of the federal tax credit for research and development activities. We recognized the benefit from the reinstatement of the tax credit for 2012 and 2013 during the year ended December 31, 2013. Quarterly Results of Operations Data The following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2014. We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements, accordingly. As of January 27, 2013, we had a valuation allowance of $224.8 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period. Our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $459.1 million as of January 27, 2013.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 25, 2015, we had a valuation allowance of $261.0 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. Our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $411.9 million as of January 25, 2015. Consistent with prior years, the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity, if and when realized. In determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to utilize the with-and-without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits. We have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes, and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operations. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.", "ITEM 5.
