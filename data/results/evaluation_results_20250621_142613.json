The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs. The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes. The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows: Convertible Debt 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of Convertible Notes. During fiscal year 2019, we paid cash to settle an aggregate of $16 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and issued 714 thousand shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value. The related loss on early conversions was not significant. As of January 27, 2019, there were no Convertible Notes outstanding. Note Hedges Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the Note Hedges. Through January 27, 2019, we had received 57 million shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $1.50 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes. As of January 27, 2019, there were no Note Hedges outstanding. Revolving Credit Facility We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of January 27, 2019, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement. Commercial Paper We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019: As of January 26, 2020, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

As of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016, there were 22 million and 14 million shares, respectively, of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $246 million, $75 million, and $62 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Upon exercise of an option, we issue new shares of stock. The total fair value of options vested was $8 million, $17 million, and $33 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 3 - Net Income Per Share The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: (1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares. (2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares. The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes, or the Convertible Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.0662 per share. The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding are also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Warrants have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the quarter exceeds the adjusted strike price of $27.0122 per share. For fiscal year 2017, our average stock price was $59.30, which exceeded both the adjusted conversion price and the adjusted strike price, causing the Convertible Notes and the Warrants to have a dilutive impact. The denominator for diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge transactions, or the Note Hedges, that we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, as its effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of the Convertible Notes, the shares delivered to us under the Note Hedges will offset the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the Convertible Notes. On December 12, 2016, we entered into an agreement with a counterparty bank to terminate 63 million of the 75 million Warrants outstanding. In consideration for the termination of these Warrants, we delivered a total of 48 million shares of common stock to the counterparty bank, the amount of which was determined each day based on the daily volume-weighted average price of the common stock during an observation period beginning December 13, 2016 and ending January 31, 2017. As of January 29, 2017, 44 million of the 48 million shares of our common stock had been issued related to the terminated Warrants. The remaining 4 million shares were issued in the beginning of fiscal year 2018. Please refer to Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants.",

The commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a 5-year period ending on October 7, 2021, on which all outstanding obligations would be due and payable. The Credit Agreement also permits us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments up to $425 million, subject to certain conditions. As of January 29, 2017, we had not borrowed any amounts under the Credit Agreement.

Lease Obligations Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California and includes eight buildings that are leased properties.",
                    "As this condition was met, the Convertible Notes first became convertible at the holders' option beginning on the first day of fiscal year 2017 and continued to be convertible at the holders\u2019 option through April 30, 2017. NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) During fiscal year 2017, we paid cash to settle an aggregate of $673 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and have $827 million in principal amount outstanding as of January 29, 2017. We issued 23 million shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value, and recognized a loss of $21 million on early conversions, of the Convertible Notes. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $111.77 on the last trading day of fiscal year 2017, the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $3.78 billion. Subsequent to January 29, 2017, we have settled an additional $502 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes and issued 20 million additional shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value. Based on additional conversion requests we have received, we expect to settle an additional $103 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes and issue additional shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value during the remainder of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and to settle another additional $55 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes and issue additional shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The actual number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based upon the terms of the Convertible Notes, and we expect to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock under the terms of the Note Hedges. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes at issuance, since our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal could be fully or partially settled in cash. The liability component was assigned by estimating the fair value of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and the liability component was assigned as the equity component. The initial liability component of the Convertible Notes was valued at $1.35 billion and the initial carrying value of the equity component recorded in additional paid-in-capital was valued at $126 million. This equity component, together with the $23 million purchaser's discount to the par value of the Convertible Notes, represented the initial aggregate unamortized debt discount of $148 million. The debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method and an interest rate of 3.15%. As of January 29, 2017, the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as a current liability and the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table presents the carrying value of the liability of the Convertible Notes: (1) As of January 29, 2017, the remaining period over which the unamortized debt discount will be amortized is 1.8 years."
