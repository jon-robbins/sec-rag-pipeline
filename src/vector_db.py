"""
Backward compatibility wrapper for the refactored SEC Vector Store.

The original vector_db.py has been refactored into multiple modules under
src/sec_vectorstore/. This file maintains backward compatibility by re-exporting
the main classes and functions.

For new code, import directly from src.sec_vectorstore instead.

NEW RAG CAPABILITIES:
- vs.answer(question) - Get AI-generated answers based on retrieved chunks
- vs.summarize(topic) - Get AI-generated summaries of topics
- Automatic query parsing and context-aware responses
